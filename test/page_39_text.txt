Expect economic disruptions and increased 
costs from necessary disaster prevention, 
cleanup, recovery, and operation of 
essential services during disasters. Climate 
changes—both gradual and abrupt—disrupt 
the flow of goods and services that form 
the backbone of economies (Houser et al. 
2015). Climate change impacts are expected 
to increasingly affect trade and economies 
internationally beyond American Sāmoa and 
the United States. Import and export price 
fluctuations and unanticipated impacts on 
supply chains and customers can disrupt 
local businesses (Smith et al. 2018). Some 
financial institutions are requiring demon­
strated climate adaptation plans to secure 
financing for new development.
• 
Monitor and research innovative 
insurance mechanisms. The risks posed 
by climate change are often too great for 
companies, individuals, and local 
governments to cover on their own.

Effects of Extreme Weather & Climate Change on Key Sectors   
The “Valley of the Giants” on Ta‘u- contains some of the oldest and largest coral heads in the world. The Porites 
coral head pictured here is Fale Bommie, named in honor of Fale Tuilagi, the biologist from American Sa-moa who 
monitored it and revealed it. Photo credit: Underwater Earth / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Christophe Bailhache.
• 
Consider traditional ecological 
knowledge and management practices 
when developing adaptation strategies. 
Local customary knowledge is crucial for 
forest conservation solutions. Much of 
the lowlands in the south side of Tutuila 
have been cleared for development and 
agriculture, though rainforest on steep 
slopes remains uncut. This conversion 
threatens native plants and animals that 
play important roles in traditional medicine 
and culture as well as the islands’ ecology 
and natural beauty (ASCC 2010).

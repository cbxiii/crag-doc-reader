0.72 feet per 100 years from 1948 to 2009, with 
a 95% confidence (Fig. 12, NOAA 2020c). The 
earthquake in 2009 caused a rise in the tide 
gauge record, with the water levels mirroring 
the post-seismic land subsidence in the Samoan 
Archipelago. The tide gauge in Pago Pago was 
attached to a seawall, which moved downward 
as the island subsided, resulting in a relative rise 
in sea level. While the 2009 earthquake initially 
caused Tutuila to rise about 2 to 3 inches, it 
subsequently subsided by about 7 to 9 inches 
over the next several years due to “relaxation 
from the earthquake deformation” (Mörner et al. 
2018). There is currently no working tide gauge 
in Pago Pago, as it stopped operating in early 
2020. 
For local relative sea level change scenarios, see 
the NOAA DigitalCoast Sea Level Change Curve 
Calculator: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/
tools/curve.html and the USACE Sea-Level 
Change Curve Calculator: http://corpsmapu.
usace.army.mil/rccinfo/slc/slcc_calc.html. 
Using the GPS record and tapering subsidence 
while considering thermal and regional ENSO 
influences, NOAA and the US Army Corps of 
Engineers estimated a relative sea level change 
trend of 0.35 inches (0.89 cm) per year with 
a high margin of error (+/- 0.386 in; 0.98 cm) 
(USACE 2019) (low confidence). The USACE 
Sea-Level Change Curve Calculator (Version 
2019.21) estimated a sea level rise of 3 feet in a 
period of 45 years (from 2020 to 2065) and up 
to 7 feet (rounded up) in 80 years (from 2020 to 
2100) (USACE 2019) (Fig. 7).
Scientific understanding of the timing and 
magnitude of future global sea level rise 
continues to evolve and improve. The Fourth

Figure 12. The plot shows the monthly mean sea level at Pago Pago Harbor without the regular seasonal 
fluctuations due to coastal ocean temperatures, salinities, winds, atmospheric pressures, and ocean currents. 
The long-term linear trend is also shown (red line), including its 95% confidence interval (black lines). The plotted 
values are relative to the most recent Mean Sea Level datum established by NOAA CO-OPS. The calculated 
trends for all stations are available as a table in millimeters/year and in feet/century (0.3 meters = 1 foot). 
The solid vertical line in 2009 indicates a major earthquake in the vicinity of the station. Source: NOAA Tides 
& Currents. Relative sea level trend at Station 1770000 Pago Pago, American Samoa, 2020.

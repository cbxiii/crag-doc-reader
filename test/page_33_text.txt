Effects of Extreme Weather & Climate Change on Key Sectors   
flow of sediment and nutrients to coasts and 
nearshore marine environments.
• 
Expect less frequent but more intense 
tropical cyclones and storm surges. When 
combined with continued acceleration in 
global average sea level rise, the storm surge 
associated with tropical cyclones has the 
potential to destroy built and natural infra­
structure at the coast and severely disrupt 
communities. 
• 
Monitor new scientific understanding of 
the timing and magnitude of future global 
sea level rise. Regular updates of manage­
ment plans and engineering codes may be 
increasingly important as new information 
about sea level rise and shorter-term climate 
variability becomes available.

ocean swell, led to homes being flooded. Photo by Kelley Anderson Tagarino.

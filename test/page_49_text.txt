Figure 13. Six representative Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise scenarios for 2100 (six colored 
lines) relative to historical geological, tide gauge, and satellite altimeter GMSL reconstructions 
from 1800 to 2015. The colored boxes show central 90% conditional probability ranges of RCP-
based GMSL projections from recent studies. Dashed lines extending from the boxes show the 
median contribution from Antarctic melt from recent studies. Source: Sweet et al. 2017.
National Climate Assessment, Vol. 1: Climate 
Science Special Report (USGCRP 2017), 
“Chapter 12: Sea Level Rise,” Key Message 
2, states: “Relative to the year 2000, Global 
Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is very likely to rise 
by 0.3–0.6 feet (9–18 cm) by 2030, 0.5–1.2 feet 
(15–38 cm) by 2050, and 1.0–4.3 feet (30–130 
cm) by 2100 (very high confidence in lower 
bounds; medium confidence in upper bounds for 
2030 and 2050; low confidence in upper bounds 
for 2100). Future pathways have little effect 
on projected GMSL rise in the first half of the 
century, but significantly affect projections for 
the second half of the century (high confidence). 
Emerging science regarding Antarctic ice 
sheet stability suggests that, for high emissions 
scenarios, a GMSL rise exceeding 8 feet (2.4 
m) by 2100 is physically possible, although the 
probability of such an extreme outcome cannot 
currently be assessed. Regardless of pathway, it 
is extremely likely that GMSL rise will continue 
beyond 2100 (high confidence).” (Fig. 13)
Table 1 (next page) shows the probability of 
exceeding each of six scenarios for global mean 
sea level in 2100 under three of the Representa­
tive Concentration Pathways (RCPs). However, 
new evidence regarding the Antarctic Ice 
Sheet would support much higher probabilities 
of exceeding the Intermediate-High, High, 
and Extreme scenarios in 2100 (Sweet et al. 
2017). In American Sāmoa and other islands 
in the South Pacific, because they are far from 
all sources of melting land ice, sea level rise 
is projected to be greater than GMSL due to 
static-equilibrium effects (Sweet et al. 2017; 
USGCRP 2017: 12.5.4). Thus, GMSL rise of 
1.6 feet (0.5 m) in 2100 translates into 
approximately 1.7 feet of local sea level rise in 
American Sāmoa. And, GMSL rise of 6.6 feet 
(2.0 m) in 2100 would mean about 8.6 feet in 
American Sāmoa (Sweet et al. 2017).

Air temperature factors into many realms of 
decision-making, from public health to utilities 
and building construction. Air temperature 
is also a key indicator of climate change. The 
average annual temperature from 1967 to 
2020 was 80.6°F. The number of hot days 
(above 90°F/32°C) in American Sāmoa has 
increased from an average of about 9 days in 
the first decade records were kept (1967–1976), 
to an average of about 22 days per year in the 
last decade (NOAA 2020b) (Fig. 2). The best 
available data (longest continuous record) 
is from the weather station at the Pago Pago 
International Airport in Tāfuna. A secondary 
dataset is available from the NOAA Atmo­
spheric Research Observatory in Tula but is not 
included in this analysis due to issues with data 
consistency and equipment changes.
The number of cool nights (with minimum 
temperature below 73°F/23°C) has decreased. 
Pago Pago experienced an average of about 
85 cool nights per year in the first decade that 
records were kept (1967–1976). In the last 
decade, the number of cool nights decreased to 
an average of 4 nights per year (NOAA 2020b) 
(Fig. 3).
This discussion of indicators of climate change 
in American Sāmoa builds on previous work 
that includes State of Environmental Condi­
tions in Hawai‘i and the U.S. Affiliated Pacific 
Islands under a Changing Climate: 2017 (Marra 
and Kruk 2017), Climate Variability, Extremes 
and Changes in the Western Tropical Pacific: 
2014 (Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014), 
and work of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC). Indicators were 
derived through a series of formal and informal 
discussions with a variety of stakeholders in 
the public and private sectors and members 
of the scientific community. Criteria for their 
selection included regional and local relevance 
and an established relationship to climate 
variability and change (Marra and Kruk 2017).

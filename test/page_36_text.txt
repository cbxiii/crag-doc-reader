Effects of Extreme Weather & Climate Change on Key Sectors   
• 
Expect climate change to worsen 
impacts on agriculture and agroforest 
production. In American Sāmoa the value 
of locally grown agricultural goods is large, 
accounting for $49.3 million annually or 
9% of GDP (Polhemus 2017). Farms and 
agroforests are already exposed to impacts 
from flooding, drought, winds, diseases, 
pests, soil erosion, and clearing for devel­
opment. Climate change will exacerbate 
these impacts for some crops and locations. 
Changing rainfall and higher temperatures, 
for example, are expected to increase pest 
and disease problems in staple crops such as 
bananas (Taylor et al. 2016). Farmers have 
already reported earlier harvest cycles for 
staple crops such as dryland taro. Aunu‘u 
Island has reported that swamp taro crops 
have been negatively impacted by saltwater 
intrusion (personal communication, Matt 
Erickson, 2019; Ian Gurr, ASCC, 2021). 
Resilience to climate change is expected to 
require changes in farming methods and 
cultivars (Bell and Taylor 2015).

Plan for warmer weather. Despite projec­
tions for increased future rainfall, rising 
temperatures will increase evapotranspira­
tion, increasing the amount of water crops 
require. Warmer temperatures can increase 
the incidence and spread of disease, as 
higher nighttime temperature does for taro 
leaf blight. 
If you are involved in agroforestry and farming…
Ocean inundation threatens taro crops in low-lying areas, as in the above photo of farmland on the island of 
Aunu‘u. Already, high seawater periodically affects some areas of taro production.  Photo by Valentine Vaeoso.

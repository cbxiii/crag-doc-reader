Figure 5. The annual number of days with extreme rainfall (over 1.5 inches per day) from 1967 to 
2020 at the international airport in American Sa-moa showed no statistically significant change 
(dashed black line). Original figure by Abby Frazier, using data from the NOAA GHCN-Daily 
database for 1967–2020 (NOAA 2020b; Menne et al. 2012).

(Marra and Kruk 2017). The increase in rainfall 
is likely due to a shift in the average location or 
intensity of the South Pacific Convergence Zone 
(SPCZ), which brings heavy localized rains 
when positioned closer to American Sāmoa. 
The increase in rainfall is mainly evident in the 
drier season, May through October. Meanwhile, 
there has been little change in rainfall from 
November through April (Australian BOM and 
CSIRO 2014). Models show a range of projected 
future annual rainfall change, from an increase 
to a decrease, and the model average is near 
zero change (Widlanksky et al. 2013; Brown et 
al. 2020). One set of dynamically downscaled 
model projections indicates an increase on 
average in annual precipitation of 11% to 18% by 
the end of the century (Zhang et al. 2016; Shuler 
et al. 2021).
The frequency and intensity of extreme 
rainfall events are projected to increase. The 
average number of extreme rainfall days per 
year shows a non-significant increase since 
the 1960s (Fig. 5). The frequency of extreme 
rainfall events is projected to increase with 
continued global warming. A 1-in-20-year event 
would become, on average, a 1-in-9-year event 
by 2090 under the low warming scenario and 
a 1-in-6-year event under the high warming 
scenario (Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014). 
Increased heavy rainfall events will likely result 
in increased runoff and increased potential for 
flooding.

Figure 7. Regional sea level rise scenarios considering subsidence are estimated at 3 feet in a period 
of 45 years (from 2020 to 2065) and approximately 7 feet in 80 years (from 2020 to 2100). Source: 
Prepared by HHF Planners in cooperation with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), 2020.
Using GPS satellite data while considering 
subsidence since the earthquake and ENSO 
influences, NOAA and the US Army Corps of 
Engineers (USACE) estimated a relative sea level 
change trend of 0.35 inches (0.89 cm) per year 
with a high margin of error (+/- 0.386 inches; 
0.98 cm) (USACE 2019). The USACE’s Sea-Level 
Change Curve Calculator (Version 2019.21) 
estimated a sea level rise of 3 feet over 45 years 
(from 2020 to 2065) and approximately 7 feet 
in 80 years (from 2020 to 2100) for American 
Sāmoa under a high scenario (USACE 2019) 
(Fig. 7). Emerging climate science suggests that 
Global Mean Sea Level rise of more than 8 feet 
by 2100 is possible, though the probability of this 
extreme outcome cannot be assessed (USGCRP 
2017). Sea level rise will cause coastal flooding to 
become more frequent and severe, which could 
be exacerbated by future increasing sea level 
variability associated with more extreme El Niño 
and La Niña events (Widlansky et al. 2015).

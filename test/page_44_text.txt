American Sa-moa Sources of Climate Data 
and Projections
Traceable Accounts
The findings in this report are based on an 
assessment of the peer-reviewed scientific 
literature, complemented by other sources 
(such as gray literature) where appropriate. 
These Traceable Accounts document the 
supporting evidence and sources of uncer­
tainty, and draw on guidance by the IPCC and 
USGCRP (2018), to evaluate the conclusions 
reported in the “Indicators of Climate Change 
in American Sāmoa” section in terms of:
• 
Confidence in the validity of a finding 
based on the type, quantity, quality, and 
consistency of evidence; the skill, range, 
and consistency of model projections; and 
the degree of agreement in literature.
• 
Likelihood, based on statistical measures 
of uncertainty or on expert judgment as 
reported in literature.

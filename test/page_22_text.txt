Figure 6. The number of high water hours per year at Pago Pago, American Sa-moa, from 1970 to 
2019. The high water threshold (1892 mm) is defined as the Mean Higher High Water level plus 
one-third of the difference between that and the Mean Lower Low Water level at the tide gauge 
(i.e., water levels above the daily average highest tide plus a factor of the typical tidal amplitude). 
Note that since the 2009 earthquake (dashed line), vertical land motion (i.e., subsidence of the 
archipelago) contributed to the increased occurrence of high water hours. Also note that data 
during 2020 is not shown because the tide gauge stopped operating early that year. Original figure

(https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/stations/?stn=056#datums).
Relative to the year 2000, Global Mean Sea Level 
is projected to rise 0.3–0.6 feet (9–18 cm) by 2030. 
For 2050, the projected range of Global Mean 
Sea Level rise is 0.5–1.2 feet (15–38 cm), and by 
2100 the projected range is 1.0–4.3 feet (30–130 
cm) (USGCRP 2017). However, these global 
projections do not account for relative sea level 
rise that is occurring due to the gradual sinking of 
the ground, or subsidence, still taking place after 
the September 2009 earthquake. In the decades 
prior to the 2009 earthquake and subsequent 
subsidence, the ocean around American Sāmoa is 
estimated to have risen 0.08–0.12 inches (0.2–0.3 
cm) per year, which is comparable to the global 
average rate (IPCC 2014; HHF Planners and 
USACE 2020). In the two to three years following 
the earthquake, Tutuila subsided 7 to 9 inches 
(18 to 23 cm), increasing the relative sea level rise 
experienced (Mörner et al. 2018). Because of this, 
American Sāmoa is expected to experience an 
additional sea level rise of 12–16 inches (30–40 
cm) during this century, which is approximately 
five times faster than the global average (Han et 
al. 2019).

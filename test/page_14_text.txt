Figure 1. Observed changes in key climate indicators in the Pacific Islands (top)—such as carbon 
dioxide concentration, sea surface temperatures, and species distributions—result in (bottom) 
impacts to multiple sectors and communities, including built infrastructure, natural ecosystems, 
and human health. In the top panel, red arrows signify an indicator is increasing, while blue arrows 
show the indicator is decreasing. Red and blue arrows appear together for an indicator that is 
changing and the direction of change varies. Source: Keener et al. 2018.
 Global Climate Change: Causes and Indicators   
As in all regions of the world, the climate of 
the Pacific Islands is changing. The top panel 
of Figure 1 summarizes the changes that have 
been observed by scientists through several 
key indicators. The impacts of climate change 
(Fig. 1, lower panel) are already being felt in the 
Pacific Islands and are projected to intensify in 
the future (Keener et al. 2018).

ROSE ATOLL, AMERICAN SOMOA. 79
SUMMARY.

The visible part of the rim of Rose Atoll is composed of Lithothamnium rather
than of coral, and is chiefly constituted of the same pink-colored species of Litho-
thamnium (Porolithon) now found growing over the shallows of the reef-flat.

The atoll-rim was once at least 8 feet higher than the present sea-level, and
has been largely planed down to present sea-level by the (possibly lowered) ocean
of modern times.

In common with Rose Atoll, all the volcanic islands of American Samoa indi-
cate that sea-level was at least 8 feet higher than at present.

The rock of the atoll-rim contains from about 14 to 19 per cent of magnesium
carbonate, due to its being composed largely of Lithothamnium, but not due to any
appreciable dolomitization of the limestone after its formation.

As fossil corals and Lithothamnium are found in the highest parts of the rem-
nants of the old Atoll-rim, it appears that the climate of American Samoa was tropi-
cal at the time when the sea may have stood at least 10 feet higher than at present.

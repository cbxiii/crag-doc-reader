While benthic marine algae other than encrusting forms are not often conspicuous in coral reef
habitats, they frequently form complex associations with high species diversity but low biomass.
Data from the initial phase of a detailed ecological survey of the algae on the fringing reefs
around Tutuila, American Samoa, demonstrate the widespread occurrence of algal turfs, and
illustrate the interactions between species that help to maintain the algal communities. As-
sociations between algal species are often mutually beneficial, and create significant micro-

habitats,
altered by the types of substrate available.

Algal communities also help to control substrate availability, and are themselves
In spite of their low biomass, other algae must be

considered along with encrusting forms as significant components in the coral reef ecosystern.

INTRODUCTION

Coral reefs are one of the world’s most
complex and productive ecosystems and are
the only biological community known to
produce massive geological formations. Al-
though these reefs are widely distributed
along coastal margins in tropical waters, the
diversity of coral reef forms and their com-
plexity have made it difficult to characterize
ecological features that may be common to
many reef areas and that may help to deter-
mine the nature and form of reef develop-
ment.

American Samoa, a small group of largely
volcanic islands in the South Pacific (lat.
14°S, long. 170°W), is typical of many island
areas in which coral reefs are a prominent
local resource. As part ofa long-term survey
and monitoring program, !0 line transects
were established across the intertidal and
high subtidal portions of the fringing reefs
around Tutuila Island and on nearby Aunuu
Island, representing a varictv of exposures
and habitats. Additional sites were also
examined in detail. The initial surveys were

established in January 1970, and most sta-
tions were repeated in July 1970. Collec-
tions and rough quantitative estimates of
percent coverage were made for each 10m
transect segment across the reef flat. A gen-

eral description of the area and several en-
vironmental parameters were also noted for
each transect. This approach served to
characterize the major reef flat features and
populations on a repeatable basis within the
limited time available. This paper will focus
on one aspect of the data from this program
concerning the occurrence of algal turfs and
their role in the reef community structure.

Algal turfs can be defined as relatively

dense associations of one or more species of
filamentous or foliose algae of small stature,
attaining a height or thickness of ] to 30 mm.
Turfs are a frequently occurring algal fea-
ture, particularly in tropical marine benthic
habitats, and have been periodically noted
and described (eg., 1, 3, 4, 6, 7). Generally,
however, attention has been concentrated on
the individual species within the turf, rathe1

than on the nature of the associations be-

tween species or the role of the turf commun-

itv in the ecosystem.

Turfs may be of particular significance in
tropical reef areas where other benthic algae
are scarce. They may make a significant
contribution to productivity, aid in the con-
solidation of reef materials, and control sub-
strate availability. They are frequently
highly complex and diverse assemblages.
Species composition, community structure,
and habitat vary greatly, even within the
same area. A much greater mass of data

will be required before any generalizations
about the turf community can be substan-
tiated. It is nevertheless useful to consider
this association as a unit with respect to its
role in coral reef ecosystems.

Little information has been published on
the marine algae of American Samoa. The
paper by Setchell is perhaps the most sub-
stantial, yet it was apparently based on
fragmentary collections and is incomplete (3).

RESULTS

The fringing reefs around Tutuila Island,
American Samoa, are relatively small, ex-
tending no more than a few hundred meters
from the shore. On the south shore, the
reefs extend for most of the length of the
island and generally consist of a shallow
moat near the shore (200 to 400 mm depth
at low tide), a relatively solid reef flat ex-
tending out perhaps 100 m., which is barely
exposed by the lower tides, and the reef front
itself (Fig. 1). Living corals occur primarily
on the outer portion of the reef flat and be-
yond. Breaks in the reef are generally as-
sociated with areas of freshwater runoff.
Reef development on the north shore is
primarily restricted to the bays. All the
reefs tend to be highly variable in structure
and dominant organisms, depending on the
local conditions. The flora of the basaltic
outcrops was distinctly different from that of

ther information on the structure of the reefs
at Tutuila, see Mayor (2).

A profile of the reef site near Nuuuli (Fig.
1) illustrates several of the features of the
Samoan reef flat habitats. The inshore area
consists largely of sand and a loose coral
rubble of fragments less than 100 mm long.
Scattered small coral heads towards the sea-
ward edge of the moat merge into the solid
reef flat extending to the outer edge of the
reef. Semiconsolidated calcareous rubble
predominates on the inner portion of the
reef flat with an increasing percentage of
living coral towards the reef front. Algal
turfs cover most of the available solid sur-
face in the reef moat with fleshy crusts also
common on coral fragments. Turfs de-
crease in coverage toward the outer margin
of the reef flat to be replaced by crustose
forms and then living coral. Halimeda opuntia
is common in the interstices of the rubble on
the reef flat.

In terms of percent coverage, turfs are fre-
quently the most significant algal component
in shallow reef areas. On some other tran-
sects, the relative role of encrusting coralline
algae increased, particularly on loose coral
rubble and on the outer margin of the reef,
but turf remained dominant in the more
stable areas. Extensive turfs were also noted
along subtidal channels and on the dead
portions of coral heads.

38 Section I

The species composition of Samoan algal
turfs is both complex and highly variable.
One sample of about 400 mm? from a basal-
tic substrate at Lepisi Point contained over
30 species. Some species occur only in turfs;
others are found elsewhere, often growing in
turf in a reduced form. Some of the do-
minant turf genera include Jania, Polysiphonia,
Ceramium, Hypnea, Cladophora, Gelidium, and
Laurencia. A detailed listing of the algae
present is beyond the scope of this paper.

Discussion

How do such complex associations as the
aigal turf community arise, and what signi-
ficance do they have in the reef ecosystem?
From the present monitoring surveys, it is
only possible to conclude that such turfs are
widespread and are frequently composed of
numerous species in close association. It
may be useful to suggest possible contribut-
ing factors, but detailed experimental con-
firmation will be required.

First, a number of features can be noted
about the turf habitat. It would appear to
have high potential for productivity, with
ample light and a supply of nutrients washed
onshore by reef currents and carried down
from the adjacent land. There would also
be high grazing pressure, at least intermit-
tently when high tides permit grazing fish
and other animals to emerge or to come
inshore from the outer reef. At least some
turf areas are subject to exposure at low tide,
as well as to environmental extremes such as
high light intensity, and salinity variations
with heavy rains and freshwater runoff.

There may well be species interactions
within the turf community that help to count-
er these ecological pressures. For example,
the entrance to Pala Lagoon near Nuuult
consists largely of broad shallow sand flats
carpeted with a simple association of Halimeda
and Dictyota. A dense mat of Dictyota and

scattered Padina largely covers the area,
anchored in place by hummocks of Halimeda.
The Halimeda provides the only firm attach-
ment in the sand for the Dictyota, the Dictyota
alters conditions under the mat in a way that
may or may not be beneficial to the Halimeda.

A. L. DAHL

In the turf community, Jania, Laurencia, or
Hypnea may serve a similar anchoring func-
tion for other algae, or even for the substrate.
In one area of loose rubble on the reef flat
near Anapeapca, the coral fragments have
been bound together by turf to form-a dense
resilent mat. Such binding might foster the
consolidation of the rubble into reef rock by
coralline algae or chemical processes.

One might also expect certain algae with
greater resistance to grazing or abrasion to
serve asa shelter for more delicate forms. The
dense turf form could similarly provide pro-
tection from extreme light intensities or ex-
posure, producing an internal microhabitat
more favorable to survival and growth.
There may also be nutritional, antibiotic, or
other biochemical benefits within the close
confines of the community. A dense turf
association may be better able to regenerate
rapidly after injury, or to change its species
composition with changing conditions. It is,
in all likelihood, a dynamic rather than static
association.

The significance of algal turfs for the whole
reef ecosystem is similarly open to conjec-
ture. This may well be an area of high pro-
ductivity, in which rapid growth is balanced
by heavy grazing, resulting in low biomass
but high turnover. Turfs may also control
substrate availability, preventing the settle-
ment of coral larvae and other organisms.

The widespread occurrence of algal turfs
in tropical reef habitats suggests that they
may play a significant part in reef structure
and function. Not until the roles of this and
other reef communities are more fully ex-
plored will we begin to understand the com-
plex ecosystem that is a coral reef.

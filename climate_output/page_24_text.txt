Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions 
have resulted in changes in the chemical 
composition, temperature, and circulation of 
oceans, which have ramifications for marine 
ecosystems. Changes in sea surface tempera­
ture—the temperature of water at the ocean’s 
surface—can dramatically alter conditions for 
marine organisms. Sea surface temperature has 
increased globally since 1880. 
The frequency of heat stress, which is respon­
sible for coral reef bleaching, is on the rise in 
American Sāmoa. The number of days per year 
that coral reefs are exposed to heat stress, as 
categorized by the NOAA Coral Reef Watch, has 
risen 8 days per year (in 1982–91) to 50 days (in 
2007–16) per year on average. The intensity of 
heat stress has also increased. Although not as 
severe as the impacts on the Great Barrier Reef, 
the Samoan region was repeatedly exposed to 
intense heat stress during 2000–2016, and espe­
cially during the third global bleaching event, 
2014–2017 (Fig. 8). Prolonged high temperatures 
led to significant coral death in American Sāmoa 
in 2015 and early 2017. Bleaching affected both 
shallow and deeper corals (Eakin et al. 2016); 
some staghorn corals that bleached annually 
since 2003 have recovered (Fenner and Heron 
2009; Fenner 2019). With projected warming, 
coral reefs in American Sāmoa will experience 
annual severe bleaching beginning in about 2040 
(Fig. 9) (van Hooidonk et al. 2016). Bleached 
corals typically do not reproduce in a year that 
they bleach and are more prone to disease and 
death in the future if they do recover.

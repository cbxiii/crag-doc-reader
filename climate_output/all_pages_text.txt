The Center’s 21-acre Honolulu campus, adjacent to the University of Hawai‘i at 
Ma-noa, is located midway between Asia and the US mainland and features research, 
residential, and international conference facilities. The Center’s Washington, DC, 
office focuses on preparing the United States for an era of growing Asia Pacific 
prominence.
The East-West Center hosts the core office of the Pacific RISA grant, providing 
administrative and research capabilities for the program. The Pacific RISA is one 
of the 11 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Regional 
Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) teams that conduct research that builds 
the nation’s capacity to prepare for and adapt to climate variability and change. 
This work is supported by funding from NOAA. The Pacific RISA provided primary 
oversight of this and the 2012 PIRCA report.

Indicators and Considerations for Key Sectors  CLIMATE CHANGE IN AMERICAN SA- MOA
P I R C A  2 0 2 1
Climate Change in American Sa-moa: 
Indicators and Considerations for 
Key Sectors is a report developed by 
the Pacific Islands Regional Climate 
Assessment (PIRCA). It is one in a series 
of reports aimed at assessing the state 
of knowledge about climate change 
indicators, impacts, and adaptive 
capacity of the US-Affiliated Pacific 
Islands (USAPI) and the Hawaiian 
archipelago. PIRCA is a collaborative 
effort engaging federal, state, and local 
government agencies, non-governmental 
organizations, academia, businesses, 
and community groups to inform and 
prioritize their activities in the face of a 
changing climate.
The initial phase of PIRCA activities was conducted 
during June-October 2019 and included meetings 
and workshops in American Sa-moa, the Republic of 
Palau, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands (CNMI), and Guam. Draft PIRCA reports were 
developed and refined through engagement with the 
PIRCA network. The material presented in this report 
is based largely on published research and insights 
from participants in PIRCA activities. The PIRCA 
Advisory Committee reviewed this report. Workshop 
participants and reviewers independent of the PIRCA 
workshops who made contributions are recognized 
as Technical Contributors.
The Pacific Regional Integrated Sciences and 
Assessments (Pacific RISA) program has primary 
oversight of the 2020-2021 PIRCA. The Pacific 
RISA is funded by the US National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and supported 
through the East-West Center. Key partners and 
supporters are NOAA’s National Centers for Envi­
ronmental Information (NCEI), the Department of the 
Interior’s Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science 
Center (PI-CASC), and the US Global Change 
Research Program (USGCRP).
This series represents the latest assessment in a 
sustained process of information exchange among 
scientists, businesses, governments, and communities 
in the Pacific Islands region that began with the 2012 
PIRCA (which produced Climate Change and Pacific 
Islands: Indicators and Impacts, Island Press). We 
anticipate that in conjunction with other collaborative 
regional assessment efforts, the PIRCA reports will 
provide guidance for decision-makers seeking to 
better understand how climate variability and change 
impact the Pacific Islands region and its peoples.

P I R C A  2 0 2 1
Key Issues for Managers 
and Policymakers
Increasing air temperatures – Hot days 
have increased, while the frequency of 
cool nights has decreased in American Sa-moa. Air 
temperatures will continue to rise under all future 
warming scenarios. 
More extreme rainfall and flooding – 
Extreme rainfall events are projected to 
become more frequent and intense for American 
Sa-moa, increasing runoff and the risk of flooding.
Uncertain rainfall amounts – There is 
uncertainty in how total rainfall will change 
this century in American Sa-moa. The majority 
of climate models project only small changes in 
future rainfall amounts, although some project 
changes of up to 20% in either direction. A wetter, 
drier, or unchanged future climate is possible.
Coral reef bleaching and loss – Oceans 
are warming, causing coral reef bleaching 
to become more frequent and severe in the Territory. 
Coral reefs and ocean ecosystems contribute 
millions of dollars annually to American Sa-moa’s 
economy and provide natural protection from 
floods and storms.
Sea level rise – Global and local sea level 
rise has accelerated. Land subsidence (the 
sinking of Earth’s surface) from a major earth­
quake in 2009 compounds the effects of sea level 
rise and associated coastal erosion. Sea level rise 
is also affecting the groundwater table in coastal 
plains, already infiltrating drinking water supplies. 
Currently, sea level rise inhibits crops, such as the 
Aunu‘u taufusi (wet-cropped taro), in some low-
lying areas.
Equity considerations – Climate change 
is expected to disrupt many aspects of life 
in American Sa-moa, and some groups will likely 
be affected disproportionately. Those who are 
already vulnerable, such as children, elderly 
people, people with pre-existing medical con­
ditions, and low-income communities, as well as 
those living in villages located in low-lying coastal 
or rural areas, are at greater risk from extreme 
weather and climate events. Traditional systems of 
land and marine tenure complicate relocation out 
of ancestral areas, and communities do not want to 
be separated from their lands and waters.
Threats to community health – Changes 
in rainfall and drying patterns are likely 
to lead to increased mosquito populations, which 
can increase communities’ exposure to mosquito-
borne illnesses such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, 
and lymphatic filariasis. These diseases dispropor­
tionately affect people living without screens on 
their windows, or without the means to seal their 
houses, and near objects that collect rainwater.
Risks to fresh water – Hotter temperatures 
increase the demand for water and decrease 
the fresh water available.  Additionally, sea level 
rise threatens many groundwater systems in 
low-elevation areas. Increasing knowledge and 
awareness among community members about 
how water systems may be impacted, and com­
munication among agencies and sectors that 
manage water, have the potential to boost 
resilience to climate change and other shocks 
and stressors.
Threats to ecosystems and biodiversity – 
Changes in temperature, rainfall, and 
storminess promote the spread of invasive 
species and reduce the ability of marine and 
terrestrial habitats to support rare and protected 
species. Measures that enhance biodiversity 
and improve ecosystem resilience can help 
communities to adapt.
Threats to infrastructure – More frequent 
and severe coastal flooding and increased 
coastal erosion are affecting coastal properties 
and infrastructure. These issues will be amplified in 
the coming decades as sea level rise continues to 
accelerate.

Long-term scientific observations show a 
warming trend in the climate system and the 
effects of increasing greenhouse gas concentra­
tions in the atmosphere. The factors observed 
to be changing are known as indicators of 
change. Data collected from around the globe 
show, for example:
• 
Globally, annual average temperatures over 
land and oceans have increased over the 
past century; 
• 
Oceania’s five warmest years in the past 
century have occurred since 2005, with the 
warmest year on record being 2019 (NOAA 
2020a); 
• 
Seas are rising, warming, and becoming 
more acidic; 
• 
Some ocean species are moving poleward as 
waters warm; 
• 
Sea ice is decreasing and glaciers, ice caps, 
and snow cover are shrinking.
These and many other changes are well 
documented and are clear signs of a warming 
world (USGCRP 2018, Ch. 1: Overview, Fig. 1.2, 
and Ch. 2, KM 3–7; IPCC 2014, SPM.1.1; also 
see USGCRP Indicators and EPA Indicators 
websites). 
Global Climate Change: 
Causes and Indicators
The causes of climate change
How is climate changing? 
Scientists have researched the physical science 
of climate change for almost two centuries. 
Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that 
naturally occur in the atmosphere capture the 
heat from the Sun’s energy that radiates from 
Earth’s surface, preventing some of the heat 
from escaping to space (USGCRP 2018, Ch. 1: 
Overview). Known as the “greenhouse effect,” 
this process keeps Earth habitable for life. 
However, humans have emitted an increasing 
amount of greenhouse gases into the atmo­
sphere since the late 1800s by burning fossil 
fuels (such as oil, gas, and coal) and, to a lesser 
extent, through changes in land-use and global 
deforestation. As a result, the greenhouse effect 
has intensified and driven an increase in global 
surface temperatures and other widespread 
changes in climate. These changes and the rate 
at which they are happening are unprecedented 
in the history of modern civilization (USGCRP 
2018, Ch. 1: Overview; USGCRP 2017, Ch. 2: 
Physical Drivers of Climate Change; IPCC 2014, 
SPM.1.2). 
Although natural climate cycles and other 
factors affect temperatures and weather patterns 
at regional scales, especially in the short term, 
the long-term warming trend in global average 
temperature documented over the last century 
cannot be explained by natural factors alone 
(USGCRP 2018; Ch. 2, Key Message 1). Human 
activities, especially emissions of greenhouse 
gases, are the only factors that can account for 
the amount of warming observed over the last 
century (USGCRP 2018; Ch. 2, KM 1; IPCC 2014, 
SPM.1.2). The largest contributor to human-
caused warming has been carbon dioxide. 
Natural factors alone would have actually had a 
slight cooling effect on climate over the past 50 
years (USGCRP 2018, Ch. 2, KM 1).

Figure 1. Observed changes in key climate indicators in the Pacific Islands (top)—such as carbon 
dioxide concentration, sea surface temperatures, and species distributions—result in (bottom) 
impacts to multiple sectors and communities, including built infrastructure, natural ecosystems, 
and human health. In the top panel, red arrows signify an indicator is increasing, while blue arrows 
show the indicator is decreasing. Red and blue arrows appear together for an indicator that is 
changing and the direction of change varies. Source: Keener et al. 2018.
 Global Climate Change: Causes and Indicators   
As in all regions of the world, the climate of 
the Pacific Islands is changing. The top panel 
of Figure 1 summarizes the changes that have 
been observed by scientists through several 
key indicators. The impacts of climate change 
(Fig. 1, lower panel) are already being felt in the

Greenhouse gas emissions from human activi­
ties will continue to affect the climate over this 
century and beyond; however, efforts to cut 
emissions of certain gases could help reduce 
the rate of global temperature increases over 
the next few decades (USGCRP 2018, Ch. 1: 
Overview and Ch. 2, KM 2). 
Globally, the largest uncertainty in projecting 
future climate conditions is the level of future 
greenhouse gas emissions, which could vary 
widely depending on the actions that human 
society takes in the coming years (USGCRP 
2018, Ch. 2, KM 2; IPCC 2014, SMP.2.1). In 
American Sāmoa, future changes in rainfall 
are also highly uncertain. Climate models 
representing our understanding of historical 
and current climate conditions are often used 
to project how our world will change under 
future conditions. To understand how different 
levels of greenhouse gas emissions could lead 
to different climate outcomes, scientists use 
plausible future scenarios to project tempera­
ture change and associated impacts (USGCRP 
2018, Guide to the Report). In this summary, 
the “high scenario” represents a future where 
reliance on fossil fuels and annual greenhouse 
gas emissions continue to increase throughout 
this century. The “low scenario” is based on 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions (about 85% 
lower emissions than the high scenario by the 
end of the 21st century).  
Current greenhouse gas emissions far outpace 
lower emissions pathways and are currently 
tracking higher than the high scenario (RCP8.5). 
Human activities have caused approximately 
1.8°F/1.0°C of warming above pre-industrial 
levels (IPCC 2018, A.1). Limiting global warming 
to 2.7°F/1.5°C, while physically possible, would 
require rapid and far-reaching transitions in 
energy, land use, cities, transportation, and 
industrial systems (IPCC 2018, C.2).
This report summarizes the observed changes 
and future projections in key climate indicators 
in American Sāmoa. Later sections describe 
climate-related issues affecting families and 
households; extreme weather and climate 
change risks and considerations for managers 
and decision-makers; and needs for informa­
tion and research. The findings are drawn 
from published literature on climate science, 
climate-related risks in the Pacific Islands, and 
risk management approaches. The American 
Sāmoa Community College and the Pacific RISA 
held a workshop in June 2019 that gathered 
knowledge, informed the report content, and 
identified research and information needs.

Air temperature factors into many realms of 
decision-making, from public health to utilities 
and building construction. Air temperature 
is also a key indicator of climate change. The 
average annual temperature from 1967 to 
2020 was 80.6°F. The number of hot days 
(above 90°F/32°C) in American Sāmoa has 
increased from an average of about 9 days in 
the first decade records were kept (1967–1976), 
to an average of about 22 days per year in the 
last decade (NOAA 2020b) (Fig. 2). The best 
available data (longest continuous record) 
is from the weather station at the Pago Pago 
International Airport in Tāfuna. A secondary 
dataset is available from the NOAA Atmo­
spheric Research Observatory in Tula but is not 
included in this analysis due to issues with data 
consistency and equipment changes.
The number of cool nights (with minimum 
temperature below 73°F/23°C) has decreased. 
Pago Pago experienced an average of about 
85 cool nights per year in the first decade that 
records were kept (1967–1976). In the last 
decade, the number of cool nights decreased to 
an average of 4 nights per year (NOAA 2020b) 
(Fig. 3).
This discussion of indicators of climate change 
in American Sāmoa builds on previous work 
that includes State of Environmental Condi­
tions in Hawai‘i and the U.S. Affiliated Pacific 
Islands under a Changing Climate: 2017 (Marra 
and Kruk 2017), Climate Variability, Extremes 
and Changes in the Western Tropical Pacific: 
2014 (Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014), 
and work of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC). Indicators were 
derived through a series of formal and informal 
discussions with a variety of stakeholders in 
the public and private sectors and members 
of the scientific community. Criteria for their 
selection included regional and local relevance 
and an established relationship to climate 
variability and change (Marra and Kruk 2017).

American Sāmoa has a tropical climate with 
wetter and drier seasons. On islands, rainfall is 
the primary source of all fresh water, making it 
essential to human communities and ecosystems. 
Rainfall patterns across the region are strongly 
linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
events. American Sāmoa’s rainfall is highly 
variable from year to year. For Pago Pago, the 
driest year on record from 1967 to 2020 
was 1998, during an El Niño, when rainfall was 
more than 59 inches below normal (Marra and 
Kruk 2017). 
At Apia in Sāmoa, average annual rainfall has 
increased since 1890, and in Pago Pago, eight of 
the last ten years have had above normal rainfall

At the Pago Pago International Airport, 
observed average air temperature has 
increased from 1967 to 2020 (Fig. 4). The mete­
orological station in Apia in the Independent 
State of Sāmoa, just 76 miles from Pago Pago, 
has a 118-year record of observations, which is 
the longest record in the entire insular Pacific 
region (Salofa and Aung 2004). At this station, 
maximum air temperatures have increased 
more in the wet season (November–April) than 
in the drier season (May–October) (Australian 
BOM and CSIRO 2014). Surface air temperature 
is expected to continue to increase this century. 
Average annual air temperature at Apia is 
expected to rise by 1.3–3.4°F (0.7–1.9°C) by 2050 
and could rise as much as 3.6–7.2°F (2.0–4.0°C) 
above the present average by 2090 (Australian 
BOM and CSIRO 2014).

(Marra and Kruk 2017). The increase in rainfall 
is likely due to a shift in the average location or 
intensity of the South Pacific Convergence Zone 
(SPCZ), which brings heavy localized rains 
when positioned closer to American Sāmoa. 
The increase in rainfall is mainly evident in the 
drier season, May through October. Meanwhile, 
there has been little change in rainfall from 
November through April (Australian BOM and 
CSIRO 2014). Models show a range of projected 
future annual rainfall change, from an increase 
to a decrease, and the model average is near 
zero change (Widlanksky et al. 2013; Brown et 
al. 2020). One set of dynamically downscaled 
model projections indicates an increase on 
average in annual precipitation of 11% to 18% by 
the end of the century (Zhang et al. 2016; Shuler 
et al. 2021).
The frequency and intensity of extreme 
rainfall events are projected to increase. The 
average number of extreme rainfall days per 
year shows a non-significant increase since 
the 1960s (Fig. 5). The frequency of extreme 
rainfall events is projected to increase with 
continued global warming. A 1-in-20-year event 
would become, on average, a 1-in-9-year event 
by 2090 under the low warming scenario and 
a 1-in-6-year event under the high warming 
scenario (Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014). 
Increased heavy rainfall events will likely result 
in increased runoff and increased potential for 
flooding.

 Indicators of Climate Change in American Sa-moa
Cyclones and tropical storms (referred to 
collectively as tropical cyclones) bring intense 
winds, torrential rainfall, high waves, and storm 
surge to islands near their path. The effects 
of a tropical cyclone strike or near miss can 
severely impact lives and property. As defined 
by the US National Weather Service, cyclones 
generally occur between November and April 
in American Sāmoa, and the risk of tropical 
storms and cyclones increases during medium-
to-strong El Niño events. The southwest Pacific 
over the short-term has seen below-average 
tropical cyclone activity from 2010 to 2015 
compared to the 30-year normal (1981–2010) 
(Marra and Kruk 2017; Knapp et al. 2010); 
however, ENSO events during the period of 
record may have obscured long-term trends. 
There is scientific consensus that the intensity 
of tropical cyclones is likely to increase in a 
warmer world due to the increase in sea surface 
temperatures (USGCRP 2017; Marra and Kruk 
2017; Knutson et al. 2015; Sobel et al. 2016; 
Zhang et al. 2016; Zhang and Wang 2017; Wang 
et al. 2016; Widlansky et al. 2019). Basins that 
warm more than the tropical average will show 
the largest increases. The change in tropical 
cyclone intensity is projected to affect stronger 
storms the most (in other words, increased 
maximum intensities), which would amplify

The frequency and duration of drought is 
expected to remain approximately the same in 
the future. In American Sāmoa and the Inde­
pendent State of Sāmoa, long-term records show 
no significant trends in consecutive dry days 
(Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014; Wimhurst 
and Greene 2021). ENSO effects on drought in 
American Sāmoa vary with the strength of the 
event. During strong El Niño events, the islands 
are significantly drier; during weak El Niño 
events, reduced tropical storm activity causes 
conditions that are drier than average. 
Streamflow records available for American 
Sāmoa are relatively short and discontinuous, 
and only one stream gauge has more than 35 
years of record and is unaffected by artificial 
diversions (Keener et al. 2012). The Atauloma 
Stream gauge on the island of Tutuila showed 
a slight and insignificant downward trend from 
1959 to 1997 (Keener et al. 2012). Projected 
rainfall increases may cause both increased 
streamflow and runoff relative to historic levels 
(Shuler et al. 2021).

Sea level rise poses many challenges to island 
communities and infrastructure because it 
brings more frequent and extreme coastal 
erosion, coastal flooding, and saltwater 
intrusion into coastal aquifers. A great deal of 
American Sāmoa’s infrastructure is located on 
the narrow band of flat land along the coast, 
making it highly vulnerable. The South Pacific 
experiences large fluctuations in sea level from 
year to year related to basin-scale processes 
such as El Niño. Sea levels also vary annually 
due to the seasonal ocean temperature cycle 
and on shorter timespans due to abrupt changes 
in winds and atmospheric pressure (in the case 
of storm surges). Despite this variability, the 
average sea level is increasing over decades and 
this increase is projected to accelerate in the 
coming decades.  


Relatively small changes in average sea level 
can have large effects on tidal flood frequency. 
In Pago Pago and other areas around Tutuila, 
land subsidence and sea level rise have caused 
high tide flooding (also called nuisance coastal 
flooding) to become more common. On 
June 23, 2017, the NOAA tide gauge in Pago 
Pago recorded a daily maximum water level of 
1.3 feet (41 cm) above the Mean Higher High 
Water (MHHW) level during the 1983 to 2001 
tidal epoch, and residents reported coastal 
flooding. Since 2014, the water level exceeded 
that same level during at least 20 days every 
year, whereas prior to the 2009 earthquake 
there was only one such daily observation. 
During 2019, 90 days exceeded the level at 
which flooding was observed. Changes in sea 
level coupled with high tide events can also 
exacerbate coastal erosion problems, although 
local erosion data is lacking.

the potential for severe damage (Widlansky 
et al. 2019).
Globally, tropical cyclone frequency shows 
a slow downward trend since the early 1970s. 
The number of tropical cyclones is projected to 
decrease across the Pacific and globally by the 
late 21st century (Kossin et al. 2016; USGCRP 
2017). In the area surrounding American 
Sāmoa and the southeast Pacific basin, the 
future projection is for an overall decrease in 
the occurrence of tropical cyclones, ranging 
between 5% and 50%, with high confidence 
(Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014; Wang et al. 
2016). Thus, the overall outlook is for fewer but 
stronger storms in the future. 
From 1981 to 2015, the frequency of gale-force 
winds has increased in the central south 
Pacific. Gale-force winds are responsible for 
moderate to high waves, which impede boating 
(Marra and Kruk 2017; Kanamitsu et al. 2002). 
Furthermore, strong winds create choppy 
seas and push water inland, causing increased 
coastal erosion and flooding (see Fig. 4.2 in 
Marra and Kruk 2017).

Figure 6. The number of high water hours per year at Pago Pago, American Sa-moa, from 1970 to 
2019. The high water threshold (1892 mm) is defined as the Mean Higher High Water level plus 
one-third of the difference between that and the Mean Lower Low Water level at the tide gauge 
(i.e., water levels above the daily average highest tide plus a factor of the typical tidal amplitude). 
Note that since the 2009 earthquake (dashed line), vertical land motion (i.e., subsidence of the 
archipelago) contributed to the increased occurrence of high water hours. Also note that data 
during 2020 is not shown because the tide gauge stopped operating early that year. Original figure 
by Matthew Widlansky, with data from the University of Hawai‘i Sea Level Center Station Explorer 
(https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/stations/?stn=056#datums).
Relative to the year 2000, Global Mean Sea Level 
is projected to rise 0.3–0.6 feet (9–18 cm) by 2030. 
For 2050, the projected range of Global Mean 
Sea Level rise is 0.5–1.2 feet (15–38 cm), and by 
2100 the projected range is 1.0–4.3 feet (30–130 
cm) (USGCRP 2017). However, these global 
projections do not account for relative sea level 
rise that is occurring due to the gradual sinking of 
the ground, or subsidence, still taking place after 
the September 2009 earthquake. In the decades 
prior to the 2009 earthquake and subsequent 
subsidence, the ocean around American Sāmoa is 
estimated to have risen 0.08–0.12 inches (0.2–0.3 
cm) per year, which is comparable to the global 
average rate (IPCC 2014; HHF Planners and 
USACE 2020). In the two to three years following 
the earthquake, Tutuila subsided 7 to 9 inches 
(18 to 23 cm), increasing the relative sea level rise 
experienced (Mörner et al. 2018). Because of this, 
American Sāmoa is expected to experience an 
additional sea level rise of 12–16 inches (30–40 
cm) during this century, which is approximately 
five times faster than the global average (Han et 
al. 2019).

Figure 7. Regional sea level rise scenarios considering subsidence are estimated at 3 feet in a period 
of 45 years (from 2020 to 2065) and approximately 7 feet in 80 years (from 2020 to 2100). Source: 
Prepared by HHF Planners in cooperation with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), 2020.
Using GPS satellite data while considering 
subsidence since the earthquake and ENSO 
influences, NOAA and the US Army Corps of 
Engineers (USACE) estimated a relative sea level 
change trend of 0.35 inches (0.89 cm) per year 
with a high margin of error (+/- 0.386 inches; 
0.98 cm) (USACE 2019). The USACE’s Sea-Level 
Change Curve Calculator (Version 2019.21) 
estimated a sea level rise of 3 feet over 45 years 
(from 2020 to 2065) and approximately 7 feet 
in 80 years (from 2020 to 2100) for American 
Sāmoa under a high scenario (USACE 2019) 
(Fig. 7). Emerging climate science suggests that 
Global Mean Sea Level rise of more than 8 feet 
by 2100 is possible, though the probability of this 
extreme outcome cannot be assessed (USGCRP 
2017). Sea level rise will cause coastal flooding to 
become more frequent and severe, which could 
be exacerbated by future increasing sea level 
variability associated with more extreme El Niño 
and La Niña events (Widlansky et al. 2015).

Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions 
have resulted in changes in the chemical 
composition, temperature, and circulation of 
oceans, which have ramifications for marine 
ecosystems. Changes in sea surface tempera­
ture—the temperature of water at the ocean’s 
surface—can dramatically alter conditions for 
marine organisms. Sea surface temperature has 
increased globally since 1880. 
The frequency of heat stress, which is respon­
sible for coral reef bleaching, is on the rise in 
American Sāmoa. The number of days per year 
that coral reefs are exposed to heat stress, as 
categorized by the NOAA Coral Reef Watch, has 
risen 8 days per year (in 1982–91) to 50 days (in 
2007–16) per year on average. The intensity of 
heat stress has also increased. Although not as 
severe as the impacts on the Great Barrier Reef, 
the Samoan region was repeatedly exposed to 
intense heat stress during 2000–2016, and espe­
cially during the third global bleaching event, 
2014–2017 (Fig. 8). Prolonged high temperatures 
led to significant coral death in American Sāmoa 
in 2015 and early 2017. Bleaching affected both 
shallow and deeper corals (Eakin et al. 2016); 
some staghorn corals that bleached annually 
since 2003 have recovered (Fenner and Heron 
2009; Fenner 2019). With projected warming, 
coral reefs in American Sāmoa will experience 
annual severe bleaching beginning in about 2040 
(Fig. 9) (van Hooidonk et al. 2016). Bleached 
corals typically do not reproduce in a year that 
they bleach and are more prone to disease and 
death in the future if they do recover.

While ocean water has a basic pH, data show 
that ocean acidification, caused by the ocean’s 
uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, 
has been slowly increasing in the waters of 
the Western Pacific (Kuchinke et al. 2014). 
This increase threatens coral reefs by making 
it harder for corals to build healthy skeletons. 
To this point, high temperatures have been 
far more damaging to coral reefs, but ocean 
chemistry will continue to change, and under 
the high scenario, all coral reefs are projected 
to exist in acidification conditions that will 
impede their ability to grow by the end of the 
century (Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014).

What Do Extreme Weather and Climate 
Change Mean for American Sa-moa’s Families, 
Households, and Vulnerable Populations?
Managing Climate Risks in the Face of 
Uncertainty 
Climate change impacts are often difficult to 
predict, leading to uncertainties in the timing, 
magnitude, or type of impacts. Resource 
managers are responding with various risk 
management approaches that can be used to 
plan for uncertainty. Risk management typically 
involves identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing 
current and future climate-related risks and 
vulnerabilities (even those with uncertainties 
that are difficult to characterize with confi-
dence), and assigning effort and resources to 
actions that reduce those risks (USGCRP 2018, 
Ch. 28, KM 3). Future economic and social 
conditions are considered alongside climate 
risks. Often, risk management allows for 
monitoring and adjusting strategies to risks and 
vulnerabilities as they evolve. Addressing equity, 
economics, and social well-being are important 
parts of effective climate risk management 
efforts (Fatoric and Seekamp 2017). 
Two such approaches, that can be used either 
separately or together, are: (i) scenario 
planning, which involves the creation of several 
potential scenarios that might develop in the 
future, based upon a set of variables or projec­
tions; and (ii) adaptive management, in which 
resource managers monitor, evaluate, and adapt 
management practices to changing environ­
mental conditions, such as rising sea levels and 
temperatures. Scenarios are used to assess risks 
over a range of plausible futures that include 
socioeconomic and other trends in addition to 
climate. Adaptive management approaches can 
benefit from technical analysis of hazards, for 
example critical infrastructure vulnerability 
assessment.
In some cases, comprehensive risk management 
helps to avoid adaptation actions that address 
only one climate stressor, such as sea level rise, 
while ignoring other current or future climate 
impacts. Maladaptation arises when actions 
intended to address climate risks result in 
increased vulnerability. For example, if a city 
builds new infrastructure designed to minimize 
the impacts from sea level rise and the sea level 
rise turns out to be higher than expected, the 
infrastructure can actually contribute to flooding 
if stormwater and sewer systems are unable to 
handle the rising water. To avoid maladaptation, 
policymakers and managers can consider a range 
of future scenarios and projected impacts over 
the lifetime of a project and communicate across 
sectors when designing solutions.
Climate change is anticipated to disrupt many 
aspects of life. Globally, more intense extreme 
weather events, flooding, the transmission of 
disease, and failing ecosystems all threaten the 
health and well-being of families and commu­
nities (USGCRP 2018, Summary of Findings). 
Additionally, climate-related risks to energy 
and food production and to the global economy 
are projected to cause large shifts in prices and 
availability of goods and lead to price shocks 
and food insecurity (USGCRP 2018, Ch. 16, 
KM 1 and 3). In American Sāmoa, economic

Effects of Extreme Weather & Climate Change on American Sa-moa’s People   
dependence on the cannery as a major employer 
means that closures due to drought or changes 
in fishery productivity or global disasters may 
have a disproportionate impact on communities 
(Dworsky and Crawley 1999).
Although climate change is expected to affect 
all people in American Sāmoa, some popu­
lations are disproportionately vulnerable. 
Social, economic, and geographic factors shape 
people’s exposure to climate-related impacts 
and how they are able to respond. Those who 
are already vulnerable, including children, older 
adults, low-income communities, and those 
experiencing discrimination, are at greater 
risk from extreme weather and climate events, 
in part because they are often excluded from 
planning processes (USGCRP 2018, Ch. 14, KM 
2; Ch. 15, KM 1–3; Ch. 28, Introduction). 
Vulnerable populations will likely be affected in 
many ways, including:
• 
Children, who have a higher rate of heat 
stroke and heat-related illness than adults, 
are at greater risk from increasing hot days 
(USGCRP 2016; EPA 2016). 
• 
Older adults and persons with disabilities are 
more vulnerable to extreme events, such as 
storms, that cause power outages or require 
evacuation. Emergency response plans 
specifically accommodating these groups can 
lessen the risks (USGCRP 2016; EPA 2016).
• 
People who work outdoors, such as tourism 
and construction workers, fisherpeople, 
farmers, and other outdoor laborers, are 
some of the first to be exposed to the effects 
of heat and extreme weather (USGCRP 2016; 
Schulte and Chun 2009).
• 
People who live, work, go to school, or 
otherwise spend time in locations that are 
more directly affected by climate risks, such 
as coastal and other flood-prone areas, are 
more likely to experience higher risks to 
health and safety (USGCRP 2016).
• 
Pacific Islanders, including Samoans, have an 
inseparable connection to and derive their 
sense of identity from the lands, territories, 
and resources of their islands (Keener et al. 
2018). Traditional systems of land ownership 
complicate relocation out of ancestral areas 
that are exposed to climate impacts because 
communities prioritize remaining on familial 
land (US Department of Commerce 2012). 
Actions to address the causes and impacts of 
climate change can also affect certain popula­
tions, such as those with lower incomes, more 
than others if such actions do not consider 
existing inequalities (USGCRP 2018, Ch. 11, 
KM 4 and Ch. 28, KM 4). Management and 
emergency response plans that include specific 
accommodations for more vulnerable groups 
can help to address inequalities and save lives, 
and the design of climate-ready infrastructure 
can encourage widespread participation in 
decision-making. 
Global action to significantly cut greenhouse gas 
emissions can reduce climate-related risks and 
increase opportunities for these populations 
in the long term. For example, health-related 
impacts and costs across the United States are 
projected to be 50% lower under a lower warm-
ing scenario (RCP 4.5) than a higher scenario 
(RCP 8.5) (USGCRP 2018).

What Do Extreme Weather and Climate Change 
Mean for American Sa-moa’s Key Sectors?
The PIRCA suggests the following considerations for managers working in these 10 key sectors 
based on an up-to-date review of published literature on climate science, climate-related risks in 
the Pacific Islands, and risk management approaches.
If you are a water resources or utilities manager…
• 
Prepare for increased land-based pollution 
in groundwater and surface water. Land-
based pollution has been a persistent problem 
affecting drinking water quality in American 
Sāmoa, particularly in the central water 
system (Shuler et al. 2019). The projected 
increase in the frequency and intensity of 
extreme rainfall events means that pathogens 
will be flushed into the water systems at 
greater rates and that spikes in contamination 
of groundwater will likely become more 
frequent and extreme (Wallsgrove and Grecni 
2016; Shuler et al. 2021). 
• 
Monitor salt concentrations in ground-
water wells that already have high chloride 
levels. Some wells on the east side of Tutuila 
and on Aunu‘u island (Izuka 1996; Shuler and 
El-Kadi 2018) have high chloride (or salt) 
levels when there is less rainfall than usual, 
putting them at a greater risk of becoming 
saltier as the sea level rises. The projected 
increase in rainfall and groundwater recharge 
might compensate for this increase in salinity 
(Shuler et al. 2021). Since it is uncertain 
exactly how these wells will change in the 
future, it is important to maintain a robust 
observation and monitoring network for wells 
near the coast. 
• 
Hardening measures to protect electrical, 
water, wastewater, and other infrastructure 
can improve reliability and resilience of 
core services. Sea level rise will cause a rise 
in groundwater in nearshore developed areas. 
Buried utilities in these areas may be subject 
to sub-surface inundation through exposure to 
the saturated zone. This could cause increased 
corrosion of utilities, increased inflow and 
infiltration of wastewater lines, and even 
potential contamination of drinking water 
lines (Habel et al. 2017). Damage to utility 
infrastructure from sea level rise, or major 
storms, can cause cascading impacts on critical 
sectors. Considering both extreme weather 
and sea level rise in the design or reconstruc­
tion of infrastructure can help to avoid future 
high costs and outages.

Effects of Extreme Weather & Climate Change on Key Sectors   
• 
Expect hotter conditions to increase water 
demand and decrease available fresh water. 
Rising temperatures will increase evapo­
transpiration. The increased rate of water 
evaporation from soils, plants, wetlands, and 
streams means less water will be available 
to replenish groundwater aquifers. While 
changes in future rainfall amounts are 
uncertain, extreme rainfall is projected to 
increase and is more likely to run off into the 
ocean, rather than recharging groundwater. 
At the same time, rising temperatures increase 
the human population’s demand for water. 
• 
Energy consumption is projected to 
increase, driven by a combination of hotter 
weather and increasing population. Energy 
is used to pump and distribute water for use 
in households, agriculture, and industries. 
Increased hot days will generally increase 
the need for water and its loss through evap­
oration. Thus, a greater amount of energy 
is expected to be required to pump and 
distribute water (Gingerich et al. 2019) and 
cool homes on hot days in the future. While 
the population of American Sāmoa decreased 
from 2000 to 2010, approximately one-third 
of the population is below 15 years of age and 
may produce significant population growth, 
possibly increasing the demand for water 
and electricity (HHF Planners and USACE 
2020; Wendt et al. 2019). On the other hand, 
the small islands in American Sāmoa such as 
Manu‘a have lost half their population over 
the past several decades, and may continue 
along this trajectory. 
• 
Monitor ENSO and its effects on rainfall. 
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
strongly influences rainfall amounts, which 
vary greatly from year to year in American 
Sāmoa. Although the relationship is complex 
and variable, El Niño events typically bring 
dry weather to the Samoan region in the 
following spring and summer, and a strong El 
Niño can cause severe local drought (Fig. 10). 
Water managers can use seasonal forecasts 
to prepare for potential water shortages or 
saltwater intrusion during drought years.

If you work in public health or disaster management…
• 
Account for the consequences of climate 
change at multiple levels across the health 
sector. Climate change and extreme events 
are anticipated to affect individuals and 
communities as well as healthcare facili­
ties and public infrastructure. When they 
overlap with disease outbreaks, weather 
extremes can disrupt the public health 
sector’s response, as during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Adaptation actions at multiple 
scales are needed to prepare for and 
manage health risks in a changing climate 
(USGCRP 2018, Ch. 14, KM3).  
• 
Prepare for more frequent extreme heat 
events that are expected to increase 
heat-related illness. Even small increases 
in seasonal average temperatures can 
increase extremes, and in some places 
are observed to result in illness and 
death. Some groups have a higher risk of 
becoming ill or dying due to extreme heat, 
including people with chronic illnesses, 
older adults, and children (Sarofim et al. 
2016). Rising temperatures can also affect 
the management of non-communicable 
diseases, including diabetes, since hot 
weather makes it uncomfortable and even 
unsafe to exercise outside. To assess the 
risks of rising air temperatures and other 
climatic changes on local health, the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
developed the “Building Resilience Against 
Climate Effects” (BRACE) framework (CDC 
2019), which could be used to inform local 
climate and health strategies in American 
Sāmoa (Marinucci et al. 2014). Shock 
events can exacerbate existing heat and 
socioeconomic stressors. After the 2009 
tsunami, compounding impacts at different 
scales included lack of electricity and fresh

water, increase in insect vectors, barriers 
to receiving medical care, and an increase 
in dehydration and heat stress injuries 
(Choudhary et al. 2012).
• 
Expect more frequent water supply con­
tamination and more frequent floods. 
Heavy rains have periodically caused 
flooding in parts of the Territory, and the 
NWS issues flash flood warnings when 
rainfall rates of more than 2 inches per hour 
are predicted. This is also the approximate 
rainfall rate at which the American Sāmoa 
Power Authority observes groundwater 
wells under the direct influence of surface 
water, or “GUDI” wells, are at risk for 
contamination by pathogens (Shuler et al. 
2019); also this is when there is high flow 
into sewers. On New Year’s Day in 2017, 
flash flooding closed roads, downed power 
lines and trees, and produced landslides. 
Similar floods are expected to become more 
frequent, and flooding will intensify in a 
warmer future climate. In addition to direct 
health risks, heavy rainfall and flooding 
are linked to increased levels of pathogens 
in drinking water and can increase water­
borne disease, such as diarrheal illness 
(Bell et al. 2016; Brunkard et al. 2011). The 
island’s only hospital, Lyndon B. Johnson 
Tropical Medical Center (LBJ Hospital), 
is located near the high-hazard flood zone 
and landslide zone (Jamie Caplan Consult­
ing, LLC 2015). The hospital has flooded 
in the past and will be increasingly at risk 
of flooding and associated problems in the 
future. During King Tides and storm surge, 
travel along the coast and access to medical 
services may be jeopardized. Preparing for 
these challenges is most effectively done 
through a multi-sectoral approach.
• 
Expect stronger tropical cyclones. 
Although they may occur less frequently in 
the future in the Samoan Archipelago, the 
tropical cyclones that do affect American 
Sāmoa are expected to bring stronger 
winds, higher storm surges, and greater 
precipitation amounts. Coral reefs protect 
the shoreline by weakening wave energy. 
Sea level rise and a decline in coral cover 
could reduce the protection from storms. 
Injuries, fatalities, and mental health 
impacts are associated with strong storms, 
especially in vulnerable coastal populations. 
Health risks increase after a storm when 
infrastructure and housing is damaged, and 
electricity, sanitation, safe food and water 
supplies, communication, and transpor-
tation are disrupted. Government and 
non-governmental organizations can 
increase adaptive capacity, for example by 
providing early warning systems, evacua­
tion assistance, and disaster relief (McIver 
et al. 2016; Bell et al. 2016). Federal building 
codes and flood prevention infrastructure 
are often too expensive for vulnerable com­
munities to implement. There is a need for 
less-costly alternatives.
• 
Monitor emerging research on climate and 
vector-borne diseases. American Sāmoa 
experienced outbreaks of dengue and Zika 
in 2016. Dengue, lymphatic filariasis, and 
other mosquito-borne pathogens have 
increased as global health threats in recent 
years (Beard et al. 2016). Researchers are 
concerned that future warming and precipi­
tation changes will increase the suitable 
habitat for pathogens and vectors, thereby 
increasing the potential for instances of 
malaria, dengue fever, diarrhea, salmonel­
losis, and other diseases (Mora et al. 2018). 
Community-level adaptation measures can 
limit human vulnerability to vector-borne 
disease (Beard et al. 2016; Radke et al. 2012; 
Reiter et al. 2003).

If you are a coastal infrastructure decision-maker… 
• 
Prepare for more frequent coastal flooding 
and increased erosion to affect coastal 
villages and infrastructure. Both sea level 
rise and more frequent and intense heavy 
rainfall events will produce flooding along 
the coasts of American Sāmoa. The majority 
of the Territory’s villages and infrastructure 
are located on the floodplains of Tutuila—
including the hospital and international 
airport. Coastal roads impacted by floods 
and landslides slow the transport of goods 
and limit access to health care. American 
Sāmoa is particularly vulnerable to coastal 
erosion where there are both narrow 
fringing reefs and only thin bands of land 
available for coastal infrastructure, though 
Tutuila is less at risk than Ofu-Olosega 
and Ta‘ū. Furthermore, “maladaptation” is 
occurring. For instance, seawalls are built 
with the intention of reducing erosion, but 
often have the unintended consequence of 
causing beach loss at other locations along 
the shore, worsening the erosion problem. 
Coral reefs already protect 435 buildings 
valued at over $46.5 million in American 
Sāmoa from floods that would result from a 
10-year storm event (Storlazzi et al. 2019). 
Prioritizing reef conservation and facili­
tating replanting of mangroves provides 
additional coastal protection (Ferrario et 
al. 2014). Stream restoration is another 
nature-based solution that can slow the

flow of sediment and nutrients to coasts and 
nearshore marine environments.
• 
Expect less frequent but more intense 
tropical cyclones and storm surges. When 
combined with continued acceleration in 
global average sea level rise, the storm surge 
associated with tropical cyclones has the 
potential to destroy built and natural infra­
structure at the coast and severely disrupt 
communities. 
• 
Monitor new scientific understanding of 
the timing and magnitude of future global 
sea level rise. Regular updates of manage­
ment plans and engineering codes may be 
increasingly important as new information 
about sea level rise and shorter-term climate 
variability becomes available.

If you are involved in fisheries or managing ocean resources...  
• 
Coral reefs in American Sāmoa have 
already experienced increased frequency 
of bleaching. In the next few decades, 
more frequent coral bleaching events and 
ocean heatwaves will combine with other 
stressors such as erosion, sedimentation, 
pollution, and overfishing to increasingly 
threaten coral reefs and the livelihoods they 
support. The overall value of coral reefs 
is estimated to be at least $10 million per 
year in American Sāmoa (US Department 
of Commerce 2012). By 2040, widespread 
coral bleaching and mortality is projected to 
occur annually (van Hooidonk et al. 2016). 
Some populations of staghorn corals in 
backreef pools were observed to have partial 
colony bleaching annually since 2003 and 
have recovered (Fenner and Heron 2009; 
Fenner 2019). However, repeated or extreme 
global ocean heatwaves are linked to local 
coral death. The identification, cultivation, 
and out planting of resilient corals can be 
a locally effective management strategy 
(Score 2017), although it should not be 
viewed as a panacea—even farmed corals 
will be challenged by high temperatures, and 
storms can damage farms. Greenhouse gas 
emissions reductions on a global scale may 
aid the survival of resilient corals locally. 
Studies have found that reefs with the 
highest future resilience potential are in geo­
graphically defined zones, with northeastern 
Tutuila scoring the highest, northwest and 
southwest zones rated as having interme­
diate resilience, and southeastern Tutuila 
scoring the lowest (Schumacher et al. 2018).

• 
Expect reduced available catch for 
subsistence and commercial fishing. 
Climate change and ocean acidification are 
expected to cause coral reef fish to decline 
20% by 2050 (Bell et al. 2013). Fishing and 
exploitation of coral reef resources are 
expected to further exacerbate the effects 
on reef fish populations (Cheng and Gaskin 
2011). Rapidly changing conditions also 
affect open ocean fisheries and declines in 
maximum potential catch of more than 50% 
are projected under a business-as-usual 
scenario by 2100 for most of the islands in 
the Central and Western Pacific, including 
American Sāmoa (Asch et al. 2018; Bell et 
al. 2013). Increased drought and declines 
in potential catch could both have negative 
impacts on StarKist Samoa Tuna Cannery 
operations in Pago Pago, which traditionally 
has employed more than 1,500 workers 
(Frazier et al. 2019).
• 
Expect increased temperatures to 
negatively affect aquaculture. There are 
about 25 tilapia farms on Tutuila that are 
used for subsistence purposes. Tilapia 
aquaculture in American Sāmoa already 
exists at the upper limit of the temperature 
threshold. With the minimum expected 
temperature rise, fry (juvenile fish) will die 
and stocks will decrease in the absence of 
modifications to control water temperatures 
(personal communication, Kelley Anderson 
Tagarino, 2019).

• 
Expect climate change to worsen 
impacts on agriculture and agroforest 
production. In American Sāmoa the value 
of locally grown agricultural goods is large, 
accounting for $49.3 million annually or 
9% of GDP (Polhemus 2017). Farms and 
agroforests are already exposed to impacts 
from flooding, drought, winds, diseases, 
pests, soil erosion, and clearing for devel­
opment. Climate change will exacerbate 
these impacts for some crops and locations. 
Changing rainfall and higher temperatures, 
for example, are expected to increase pest 
and disease problems in staple crops such as 
bananas (Taylor et al. 2016). Farmers have 
already reported earlier harvest cycles for 
staple crops such as dryland taro. Aunu‘u 
Island has reported that swamp taro crops 
have been negatively impacted by saltwater 
intrusion (personal communication, Matt 
Erickson, 2019; Ian Gurr, ASCC, 2021). 
Resilience to climate change is expected to 
require changes in farming methods and 
cultivars (Bell and Taylor 2015).
• 
Plan for warmer weather. Despite projec­
tions for increased future rainfall, rising 
temperatures will increase evapotranspira­
tion, increasing the amount of water crops 
require. Warmer temperatures can increase 
the incidence and spread of disease, as 
higher nighttime temperature does for taro 
leaf blight. 
If you are involved in agroforestry and farming…
Ocean inundation threatens taro crops in low-lying areas, as in the above photo of farmland on the island of 
Aunu‘u. Already, high seawater periodically affects some areas of taro production.  Photo by Valentine Vaeoso.

If you are involved in recreation or tourism…
• 
If land-based pollution is not reduced, water 
in streams and at shorelines and beaches 
will be polluted more often. Poor stream and 
beach water quality is an ongoing issue in 
American Sāmoa. Of the 41 watersheds, 28 
were recently classified as impaired, meaning 
their streams or shorelines, or both, do not 
safely support recreational uses (Wallsgrove 
and Grecni 2016). Land-based pollution, 
including human and pig waste, often con­
taminates streams and nearshore waters (US 
Department of Commerce 2012). As both the 
number of heavy rainfall days per year and 
the amount of rain falling during those events 
increase, users of streams, shorelines, and 
beaches should expect more days of unsafe 
water per year and more watersheds catego­
rized as impaired. 
• 
Prepare for coral reefs to support fewer 
recreational opportunities. Although the 
number of tourists visiting American Sāmoa 
has declined and is relatively small, coral 
reefs generate approximately $1.07 million 
per year in direct tourism and reef-adjacent 
activities for American Sāmoa (Spurgeon 
et al. 2004; Spalding et al. 2017) (Fig. 11). In 
the next few decades, more frequent coral 
bleaching events and ocean acidification will 
combine with other stressors to threaten 
coral reefs. By 2040, coral bleaching is 
projected to occur annually in American 
Sāmoa’s waters, potentially resulting in 
widespread coral mortality (van Hooidonk et 
al. 2016). 
• 
Prepare for more food insecurity in 
American Sāmoa’s households. More than 
95% of food in American Sāmoa is imported. 
It is highly likely that climate change will 
drive up the prices of imported foods, 
threatening food security (USGCRP 2018, 
Ch. 16). Traditional farming systems can 
enhance resilience to external shocks and 
help to bolster food security (McGregor et 
al. 2009). With a gradual shift away from 
agroforestry, the food production systems 
in the Pacific Islands have become more 
vulnerable (Taylor et al. 2016).

• 
Changes in temperature, rainfall, and 
storminess promote the spread of invasive 
species and reduce the ability of terrestrial 
habitats to support protected species. 
Lowland deforestation, landslides, erosion, 
runoff, and invasive alien plants and animals 
threaten American Sāmoa’s native rainforest 
ecosystems. American Sāmoa’s forests have 
low-to-medium plant and animal species 
diversity, and are home to several protected 
animal species, as well as endemic and 
rare trees and other culturally important 
plants. Changing climatic conditions pose an 
additional risk to native plants and animals 
(ASCC 2010). 
• 
Expect declining ocean ecosystem health. 
Watershed conservation measures can 
protect refugia for coral populations. 
American Sāmoa has experienced signifi­
cant outbreaks of crown-of-thorns (COTS) 
sea stars in the last several decades and as 
recently as 2015, which damaged local reefs. 
Successful eradication efforts have largely 
controlled COTS populations, but increases 
in storms and nutrient runoff could increase 
them again (Clark 2013), which in turn 
would damage reefs and decrease beach 
protection.
• 
Measures that protect and enhance bio-
diversity and ecosystem services are critical 
to support communities in adapting to 
climate change. Natural resources underpin 
the sustenance and resilience of Pacific Island 
communities (Barnett and Campbell 2010). 
For example, mangrove forests can provide 
storm protection and building materials, 
and are productive estuaries (Victor et al. 
2004). Significant portions of mangrove 
forests have been lost to human land use in 
American Sāmoa; only five stands across 
two islands remain, and replanting has had 
varying success (EcoAdapt 2016). Despite 
existing policies, clearing and cutting already 
threaten mangroves, which will be addition­
ally stressed by projected climate impacts 
such as storm surge, extreme high-water 
levels, changing precipitation patterns, and 
sea level rise (Gilman et al. 2008; Gilman et 
al. 2006). Restoring mangrove forests, as is 
being done in Leone on Tutuila, can help to 
protect communities against storm surge and 
coastal inundation, enabling them to adapt, 
while also providing secondary benefits such 
as maintenance of fisheries (US Department 
of Commerce 2012; Hills et al. 2013). 
If you manage ecosystems and biodiversity…
• 
Erosion of beaches and shoreline areas will 
increase. Coastal erosion and beach loss are 
already issues in American Sāmoa, and certain 
erosion-control structures (such as seawalls) 
have the unintended consequence of beach 
loss and ecosystem damage when installed 
on chronically eroding sandy shorelines. 
Alternative erosion control practices include 
protecting and restoring coral reefs, using 
vegetative buffers, and augmenting sand in 
specific areas. Even with the potential for 
negative effects on beaches and ecosystems, 
hard engineered shoreline protection may be 
necessary in some instances to protect critical 
infrastructure.

• 
Expect economic disruptions and increased 
costs from necessary disaster prevention, 
cleanup, recovery, and operation of 
essential services during disasters. Climate 
changes—both gradual and abrupt—disrupt 
the flow of goods and services that form 
the backbone of economies (Houser et al. 
2015). Climate change impacts are expected 
to increasingly affect trade and economies 
internationally beyond American Sāmoa and 
the United States. Import and export price 
fluctuations and unanticipated impacts on 
supply chains and customers can disrupt 
local businesses (Smith et al. 2018). Some 
financial institutions are requiring demon­
strated climate adaptation plans to secure 
financing for new development.
• 
Monitor and research innovative 
insurance mechanisms. The risks posed 
by climate change are often too great for 
companies, individuals, and local 
governments to cover on their own. 
If you are involved in finance or economic development...

coral head pictured here is Fale Bommie, named in honor of Fale Tuilagi, the biologist from American Sa-moa who 
monitored it and revealed it. Photo credit: Underwater Earth / XL Catlin Seaview Survey / Christophe Bailhache.
• 
Consider traditional ecological 
knowledge and management practices 
when developing adaptation strategies. 
Local customary knowledge is crucial for 
forest conservation solutions. Much of 
the lowlands in the south side of Tutuila 
have been cleared for development and 
agriculture, though rainforest on steep 
slopes remains uncut. This conversion 
threatens native plants and animals that 
play important roles in traditional medicine 
and culture as well as the islands’ ecology 
and natural beauty (ASCC 2010).

• 
Coastal historical and cultural sites 
will likely be affected by erosion, storm 
surge, and coastal inundation from sea 
level rise. Significant ancient villages and 
World War II historical sites exist across 
American Sāmoa. Although it is not known 
how climate change will specifically affect 
individual archeological and cultural 
sites, coastal areas will likely be affected 
by erosion, storm surge, and coastal 
inundation from sea level rise (Addison 
et al. 2010). For example, Fagatele Bay 
features a historic coastal village occupied 
from prehistoric times through the 1950s. 
The Bay contains one of the few marine 
archaeological records in the territory: 
grinding holes or bait cups, known as 
foaga, carved by ancient Samoans into the 
shoreline along the reef edge (Leach and 
Witter 1985; US Department of Commerce 
2012). Increased coastal erosion threatens 
these and other significant cultural sites in 
American Sāmoa.
• 
Climate change exacerbates challenges to 
the continued availability of cultural foods 
and medicinal plants. Changes in environ­
mental conditions such as warming oceans, 
reduced streamflow, saltwater intrusion, 
and long periods of drought threaten the 
ongoing cultivation of coconut and the 
availability of traditional foods such as fish, 
other seafood, and edible seaweed (Keener 
et al. 2018). The distribution and presence 
of medicinal plants may be impacted by 
changing temperature and rainfall regimes 
(ASCC 2010), while increasing imports of 
staple foods such as banana and taro may be 
needed.
• 
Climate change may necessitate village 
relocations and change village structure. 
Pacific Islanders, including American 
Samoans, have an inseparable connection 
to and derive their sense of identity from 
the lands, territories, and resources of 
their islands (Keener et al. 2018). Tradi­
tional systems of land and marine tenure 
complicate relocation out of ancestral 
areas, and communities do not want to 
be separated from their lands and waters, 
which also complicates Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) assistance 
funding that may be contingent upon 
relocation. Coastal or remote villages may 
be more vulnerable to these impacts.  
If you are a cultural or historical resources steward…
Countries with greater insurance coverage 
across sectors are found to experience 
better GDP growth after weather-related 
catastrophes (Melecky and Raddatz 2011). 
There are an array of options to manage 
climate-related risks, such as weather-
indexed insurance products and risk 
transfer-for-adaptation programs. Some 
cities and states have bought catastrophe 
bonds or parametric insurance policies. 
For example, the government of Quintana 
Roo, Mexico, purchased a parametric policy 
that would provide up to $3.8 million to 
repair hurricane damage to their coral 
reef (Gonzalez 2019). This kind of policy 
provides a fast payout to quickly address 
impacts from a triggering event.

• 
Expect greater public health threats 
to students. Children are especially 
vulnerable to heat-related illness, including 
dehydration, heat stress, fever, and exacer­
bated respiratory problems. The increasing 
frequency and intensity of hot days, as well 
as stronger storms, could result in health 
impacts for students (Sarofim et al. 2016), 
especially if the schools are in locations 
more vulnerable to increased heat. 
• 
Utilize locally translated resources to 
better communicate about climate impacts 
with village leaders and educators. It is 
important that Samoans be able to com­
municate about environmental and climate 
change processes in a consistent manner, 
using the same English and Samoan terms 
and definitions. The Resilient Resources 
Samoan Language glossary provides a 
common and accepted set of words and 
definitions to be used by all relevant 
agencies and organizations when discussing 
climate change and resilience issues in 
Samoan. (American Sāmoa Coral Reef 
Advisory Group Project Lotonuu 2018). 
• 
Consider the potential impacts of hotter 
days on student learning and classroom 
design. Research has found that cumulative 
exposure to heat negatively impacts 
students’ ability to learn (Goodman et 
al. 2018). Innovative school building 
designs that reflect local environmental 
conditions—including projected increases 
in air temperature—can benefit students’ 
health and learning outcomes.
• 
Prepare for stronger hurricanes and 
storm surge, and consider options for 
schools and educational facilities at 
the coastline. Erosion, storm surge, and 
coastal inundation from sea level rise 
will likely affect schools along the coast 
or in low-lying areas, causing temporary 
school closures and the need for repairs or 
rebuilding. Continually updating building 
and energy codes is known to improve 
community safety and resilience. Locating 
and designing buildings to accommodate 
sea level rise can avoid costs and protect 
students.

 Effects of Extreme Weather & Climate Change on Key Sectors
• 
Assessments of vulnerability – Risks posed 
by extreme weather and climate change 
vary by the vulnerability of the people 
experiencing impacts. Particularly needed 
are assessments of risks that account for the 
socioeconomic and other factors that drive 
vulnerability of people in American Sāmoa 
to climate extremes and changes. Such 
studies can improve understanding of who 
is at greatest risk and inform pre-disaster 
recovery plans. Due to the traditional land 
tenure system in American Sāmoa, where 
extended families communally own land 
that is managed by a chief, or matai, not by 
the government, it is necessary to engage the 
chiefs at the village level in order to create 
effective resilience plans (Page et al. 2012).
• 
Critical infrastructure vulnerability 
assessment – Governments and resource 
managers commonly use various forms of 
vulnerability assessment as a foundational 
tool to tailor solutions and policies to address 
the specific ways critical infrastructure is 
threatened. Assessing climate vulnerability 
involves technical analysis of changing 
hazards, often evaluates exposure, sensitivity, 
and adaptive capacity, and provides rankings 
of the seriousness of various climate risks. 
With the exception of the Climate Related 
Vulnerability Assessment for Transpor­
tation Infrastructure (HHF Planners and 
USACE 2020) completed for the American 
Sāmoa Department of Public Works, 
American Sāmoa currently lacks vulnerability 
assessments of coastal, wastewater, and 
other critical infrastructure. Governments 
and engineers can learn from methods 
of completed assessments and guidance 
developed by engineering associations and 
non-governmental organizations (see for 
example: Canadian Engineering Qualifica­
tions Board 2014; HHF Planners and USACE 
2020).
• 
Centralized expertise to coordinate climate 
adaptation efforts and policies – There is 
a pervasive need for high-level expertise to 
work directly within the Territory’s agencies 
to support mainstreaming climate change 
information, strategies, and actions into their 
existing programs, plans, and projects. It is 
extremely difficult for jurisdictional govern-
ments to identify and hire the high-level 
experts needed. Direct support from the 
federal government could be used to fund 
short-term sit-in positions to help build 
capacity within and across local agencies 
(Spooner et al. 2017).
• 
Educational resources for local K–12 and 
college students and teachers – One of 
the most impactful things that individuals 
can do to help increase preparedness for 
climate change is to talk about the issues 
with their families and communities. Educa­
tional climate science resources specific to 
American Sāmoa are needed to further the 
conversation at home and at school, as well as 
training for educators in climate and environ­
mental science.
• 
Quality controls and expanded coverage in 
climate data records – Stations collecting 
climate data (air temperature, rainfall, wind 
speeds, etc.) have changed location and some 
station records are not continuous. Consistent 
data records of 30 years or more at the same 
location are needed for tracking climate 
trends and changes, and to improve and 
validate future projections. An assessment 
Needs for Research and Information
This assessment identified the following research and information needs, which if met 
could enhance and support responses to extreme weather and climate change:

University of Hawai‘i researchers worked with staff and

of the quality of the data at each station, 
especially temperature data, would provide 
a foundation for determining which data is 
best suited to climate studies. At present, only 
a single stream gauge on the island of Tutuila 
has more than 35 years of observations on 
record unaffected by upstream diversions.
• 
Data detailing specific coastal erosion rates 
and impacts, and a comprehensive shoreline 
inventory – Impacts from coastal erosion in 
American Sāmoa are severe. To enable local 
adaptation projects and infrastructure design, 
islandwide data are needed.
• 
Research and modeling on future saltwater 
intrusion into coastal aquifers – The 
impacts of sea level rise on coastal aquifers 
and potential saltwater intrusion are largely 
unknown. This knowledge gap hinders devel­
opment of effective adaptation strategies for 
water resources.
• 
Island-scale climate projections for mid-
century – Many territorial and federal 
government agencies work on five-year or 
shorter funding cycles, and existing end-of-
century climate projections are not useful for 
shorter-term adaptation and infrastructure 
planning.
• 
Development and trials for stormwater 
management – Plans are needed that account 
for combined sources of flooding, including 
inland flooding and coastal/tidal flooding.
• 
Detailed sea level rise modeling and exposure 
mapping – For exposed shorelines like those 
in American Sāmoa, the existing bathtub 
models of sea level rise are not sufficient for 
assessing exposure. More detailed modeling 
and mapping are needed, including areas of 
projected erosion and the spatial extent of wave 
runup. The University of Hawai‘i is developing 
a relative sea level rise viewer that combines 
island subsidence and global sea level rise and 
provides an anticipated timeline of impacts.
• 
Economic loss from sea level rise scenario 
mapping – Research on the potential 
economic impacts of sea level rise—mapped 
in formats that can be used by policymakers 
and community planners—can inform climate 
adaptation planning at multiple scales (for 
example, the 2017 Hawaii Sea Level Rise 
Vulnerability and Adaptation Report). 
• 
Documented adaptation experiences of 
other Pacific Islands – Literature that 
conveys experiences and lessons learned from 
targeted efforts to address climate-related 
vulnerabilities can assist decision-makers in 
understanding the benefits and risks of such 
measures. For example, there is interest in how 
other Pacific Islands have implemented less 
expensive alternatives to current guidelines 
for hurricane-resistant buildings and flood 
preparation.

Temperature – The daily air temperature record 
at Pago Pago International Airport extends from 
1967 to 2020. Hot days are days that maximum 
temperature is at or above the 95th percentile of 
the distribution, corresponding to 90°F (32°C). 
Cool nights are days for which minimum tem­
peratures were colder than the 10th percentile 
of the distribution—roughly 73°F (23°C). Due to 
equipment changes in the temperature sensors 
between 1995 and 2003, breakpoints were 
found in the maximum temperature dataset. 
Therefore, the daily maximum temperature 
values were statistically homogenized to 
account for these sensor changes (see Wang 
and Feng 2013; Wang et al. 2008a; 2008b). 
In 2014, the Australian government used 
general circulation model (GCM) simulations 
taken from the international Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to 
project future climate conditions in the broad 
geographic region encompassing the Samoan 
islands. Average annual air temperature at Apia 
in the Independent State of Sāmoa, 78 miles 
northwest of Pago Pago, is expected to rise by 
1.8–3.4°F (1–1.9°C) by 2050 under the higher 
scenario (RCP 8.5, that assumes a business-
as-usual future development path with no 
major policy changes to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions) and by 1.3–2.5°F (0.7–1.4°C) under 
the lower scenario (RCP 4.5, that is based on

confidence in the projected amount of average 
temperature change.
Rainfall – Missing data in the long-term record 
is an ongoing challenge. This happens when 
observations recorded at stations are not trans­
mitted to NOAA’s National Weather Service and 
National Centers for Environmental Informa­
tion archives. Airport stations are more reliable 
because data is transmitted hourly via satellite 
(Marra and Kruk 2017). See location of selected 
Pacific region precipitation measurement 
sites (Marra and Kruk 2017, Fig. 3.4). Extreme 
rainfall is denoted as the number of days per 
year in which total rainfall exceeded 1.5 inches.
There is less certainty in the CMIP5 models as 
to the direction of projected change in average 
annual rainfall than found previously (and 
reported in CSIRO’s 2011 reports) (Australian 
BOM and CSIRO 2014; Brown et al. 2020). 
There is high confidence that the frequency and 
intensity of extreme rainfall events will increase 
under both the lower scenario (RCP 4.5) and 
the higher scenario (RCP 8.5) because: (a) a 
warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, 
so there is greater potential for extreme rainfall 
(IPCC 2012); and (b) increases in extreme 
rainfall in the Pacific are projected in all avail-
able climate models. However, there is low 
confidence in the magnitude of these changes 
(Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014). There is 
one set of dynamically downscaled climate pro­
jections available for American Sāmoa (Zhang 
et al. 2016). Those projections indicate an 
increase in annual average precipitation of 11% 
and 18% in the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios, 
respectively, by 2100. There is low confidence 
in those projections. 
Drought – The frequency and duration of 
drought events is expected to remain approx­
imately the same under the higher scenario 
(RCP 8.5). The overall proportion of time spent 
in drought in Sāmoa is expected to remain 
stable, except for a slight decrease under a 
very low (RCP 2.6) scenario (low confidence) 
(Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014). 
Streamflow – There is only a single streamflow 
record available for American Sāmoa from the 
USGS Pacific Islands Water Science Center with 
more than 35 years of record that is unaffected 
by artificial diversions (Keener et al. 2012). The 
Atauloma Stream gauge on the island of Tutuila 
showed a slight and insignificant downward 
trend from 1959 to 1997 (Keener et al. 2012), 
which does not provide enough information to 
determine a significant long-term trend. There is 
low confidence that projected increases in rainfall 
will cause increased streamflow and runoff 
relative to historic levels (Zhang et al. 2016; 
Shuler et al. 2021).
Tropical cyclones and storms – The future is 
less certain for tropical cyclones than other 
elements. The environmental conditions to 
produce a cyclone are at timescales much 
shorter than global climate model simulations; 
for example, the state of ENSO and the 
intensity and phase of the Madden-Julian 
Oscillation (Diamond et al. 2013). There is a 
medium level of confidence that global tropical 
cyclone frequency will decrease (USGCRP 
2017). In the area surrounding Sāmoa, there 
is high confidence that there will be a decrease 
in tropical cyclone frequency (Chapter 12, 
Australia BOM and CSIRO 2014). Recent 
studies detect increasing trends in tropical 
cyclone intensity in observations from 1979 
to 2017 and raise confidence in projections 
of increased tropical cyclone intensity with 
continued warming (Kossin et al. 2020).
Sea level – The long-term sea level trend for 
American Sāmoa is positive, likely indicating 
sea level rise. The relative sea level trend at 
the Pago Pago Harbor, Tutuila, is equivalent to

0.72 feet per 100 years from 1948 to 2009, with 
a 95% confidence (Fig. 12, NOAA 2020c). The 
earthquake in 2009 caused a rise in the tide 
gauge record, with the water levels mirroring 
the post-seismic land subsidence in the Samoan 
Archipelago. The tide gauge in Pago Pago was 
attached to a seawall, which moved downward 
as the island subsided, resulting in a relative rise 
in sea level. While the 2009 earthquake initially 
caused Tutuila to rise about 2 to 3 inches, it 
subsequently subsided by about 7 to 9 inches 
over the next several years due to “relaxation 
from the earthquake deformation” (Mörner et al. 
2018). There is currently no working tide gauge 
in Pago Pago, as it stopped operating in early 
2020. 
For local relative sea level change scenarios, see

Calculator: https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/
tools/curve.html and the USACE Sea-Level 
Change Curve Calculator: http://corpsmapu.
usace.army.mil/rccinfo/slc/slcc_calc.html. 
Using the GPS record and tapering subsidence 
while considering thermal and regional ENSO 
influences, NOAA and the US Army Corps of 
Engineers estimated a relative sea level change 
trend of 0.35 inches (0.89 cm) per year with 
a high margin of error (+/- 0.386 in; 0.98 cm) 
(USACE 2019) (low confidence). The USACE 
Sea-Level Change Curve Calculator (Version 
2019.21) estimated a sea level rise of 3 feet in a 
period of 45 years (from 2020 to 2065) and up 
to 7 feet (rounded up) in 80 years (from 2020 to 
2100) (USACE 2019) (Fig. 7).

National Climate Assessment, Vol. 1: Climate 
Science Special Report (USGCRP 2017), 
“Chapter 12: Sea Level Rise,” Key Message 
2, states: “Relative to the year 2000, Global 
Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is very likely to rise 
by 0.3–0.6 feet (9–18 cm) by 2030, 0.5–1.2 feet 
(15–38 cm) by 2050, and 1.0–4.3 feet (30–130 
cm) by 2100 (very high confidence in lower 
bounds; medium confidence in upper bounds for 
2030 and 2050; low confidence in upper bounds 
for 2100). Future pathways have little effect 
on projected GMSL rise in the first half of the 
century, but significantly affect projections for 
the second half of the century (high confidence). 
Emerging science regarding Antarctic ice 
sheet stability suggests that, for high emissions 
scenarios, a GMSL rise exceeding 8 feet (2.4 
m) by 2100 is physically possible, although the 
probability of such an extreme outcome cannot 
currently be assessed. Regardless of pathway, it 
is extremely likely that GMSL rise will continue 
beyond 2100 (high confidence).” (Fig. 13)
Table 1 (next page) shows the probability of 
exceeding each of six scenarios for global mean 
sea level in 2100 under three of the Representa­
tive Concentration Pathways (RCPs). However, 
new evidence regarding the Antarctic Ice 
Sheet would support much higher probabilities 
of exceeding the Intermediate-High, High, 
and Extreme scenarios in 2100 (Sweet et al. 
2017). In American Sāmoa and other islands 
in the South Pacific, because they are far from 
all sources of melting land ice, sea level rise 
is projected to be greater than GMSL due to 
static-equilibrium effects (Sweet et al. 2017; 
USGCRP 2017: 12.5.4). Thus, GMSL rise of 
1.6 feet (0.5 m) in 2100 translates into 
approximately 1.7 feet of local sea level rise in 
American Sāmoa. And, GMSL rise of 6.6 feet 
(2.0 m) in 2100 would mean about 8.6 feet in 
American Sāmoa (Sweet et al. 2017).

Ocean changes – The region was mostly free 
from long-lasting severe bleaching stress during 
the first half of the assessment period. Using 
NOAA Coral Reef Watch satellite data, a shift 
in the regime of bleaching heat stress seems to 
occur around 2001. Whereas no years prior to 
2000 recorded heat stress at Alert Level 1 or 
higher for 90% of reef grids, 9 of the most recent 
16 years had >90% of the reef grids exposed 
to Alert Levels 1 or 2 (and 7 of those years had 
100% exposure). See Fig. 6.2 in Marra and 
Kruk 2017 (Average Sea Surface Temperature 
Anomaly for the central South Pacific). There 
was local bleaching recorded in 1994 (Goreau 
and Hays 1995), demonstrating that local heat 
stress conditions may not always correspond to 
satellite monitored ocean temperatures. There 
is very high confidence in the increased risk of 
coral bleaching as the ocean warms, and medium 
confidence in the projected rate of change for the 
waters around Sāmoa because there is medium 
confidence in the rate of change of SST, and the 
changes at the reef scale (which can play a 
role in modulating large-scale changes) are 
not adequately resolved (Australian BOM and 
CSIRO 2014).

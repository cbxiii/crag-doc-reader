• 
If land-based pollution is not reduced, water 
in streams and at shorelines and beaches 
will be polluted more often. Poor stream and 
beach water quality is an ongoing issue in 
American Sāmoa. Of the 41 watersheds, 28 
were recently classified as impaired, meaning 
their streams or shorelines, or both, do not 
safely support recreational uses (Wallsgrove 
and Grecni 2016). Land-based pollution, 
including human and pig waste, often con­
taminates streams and nearshore waters (US 
Department of Commerce 2012). As both the 
number of heavy rainfall days per year and 
the amount of rain falling during those events 
increase, users of streams, shorelines, and 
beaches should expect more days of unsafe 
water per year and more watersheds catego­
rized as impaired. 
• 
Prepare for coral reefs to support fewer 
recreational opportunities. Although the 
number of tourists visiting American Sāmoa 
has declined and is relatively small, coral 
reefs generate approximately $1.07 million 
per year in direct tourism and reef-adjacent 
activities for American Sāmoa (Spurgeon 
et al. 2004; Spalding et al. 2017) (Fig. 11). In 
the next few decades, more frequent coral 
bleaching events and ocean acidification will 
combine with other stressors to threaten 
coral reefs. By 2040, coral bleaching is 
projected to occur annually in American 
Sāmoa’s waters, potentially resulting in 
widespread coral mortality (van Hooidonk et 
al. 2016). 
• 
Prepare for more food insecurity in 
American Sāmoa’s households. More than 
95% of food in American Sāmoa is imported. 
It is highly likely that climate change will 
drive up the prices of imported foods, 
threatening food security (USGCRP 2018, 
Ch. 16). Traditional farming systems can 
enhance resilience to external shocks and 
help to bolster food security (McGregor et 
al. 2009). With a gradual shift away from 
agroforestry, the food production systems 
in the Pacific Islands have become more 
vulnerable (Taylor et al. 2016).

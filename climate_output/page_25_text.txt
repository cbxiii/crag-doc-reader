Indicators of Climate Change in American Sa-moa   
While ocean water has a basic pH, data show 
that ocean acidification, caused by the ocean’s 
uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, 
has been slowly increasing in the waters of 
the Western Pacific (Kuchinke et al. 2014). 
This increase threatens coral reefs by making 
it harder for corals to build healthy skeletons. 
To this point, high temperatures have been 
far more damaging to coral reefs, but ocean 
chemistry will continue to change, and under 
the high scenario, all coral reefs are projected 
to exist in acidification conditions that will 
impede their ability to grow by the end of the 
century (Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014).

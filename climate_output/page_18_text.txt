Airport in American Sa-moa increased at a rate of 0.04°F per year (black, dotted line). Original

American Sāmoa has a tropical climate with 
wetter and drier seasons. On islands, rainfall is 
the primary source of all fresh water, making it 
essential to human communities and ecosystems. 
Rainfall patterns across the region are strongly 
linked to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
events. American Sāmoa’s rainfall is highly 
variable from year to year. For Pago Pago, the 
driest year on record from 1967 to 2020 
was 1998, during an El Niño, when rainfall was 
more than 59 inches below normal (Marra and 
Kruk 2017). 
At Apia in Sāmoa, average annual rainfall has 
increased since 1890, and in Pago Pago, eight of 
the last ten years have had above normal rainfall

At the Pago Pago International Airport, 
observed average air temperature has 
increased from 1967 to 2020 (Fig. 4). The mete­
orological station in Apia in the Independent 
State of Sāmoa, just 76 miles from Pago Pago, 
has a 118-year record of observations, which is 
the longest record in the entire insular Pacific 
region (Salofa and Aung 2004). At this station, 
maximum air temperatures have increased 
more in the wet season (November–April) than 
in the drier season (May–October) (Australian 
BOM and CSIRO 2014). Surface air temperature 
is expected to continue to increase this century. 
Average annual air temperature at Apia is 
expected to rise by 1.3–3.4°F (0.7–1.9°C) by 2050 
and could rise as much as 3.6–7.2°F (2.0–4.0°C) 
above the present average by 2090 (Australian 
BOM and CSIRO 2014).

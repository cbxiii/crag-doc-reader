Temperature – The daily air temperature record 
at Pago Pago International Airport extends from 
1967 to 2020. Hot days are days that maximum 
temperature is at or above the 95th percentile of 
the distribution, corresponding to 90°F (32°C). 
Cool nights are days for which minimum tem­
peratures were colder than the 10th percentile 
of the distribution—roughly 73°F (23°C). Due to 
equipment changes in the temperature sensors 
between 1995 and 2003, breakpoints were 
found in the maximum temperature dataset. 
Therefore, the daily maximum temperature 
values were statistically homogenized to 
account for these sensor changes (see Wang 
and Feng 2013; Wang et al. 2008a; 2008b). 
In 2014, the Australian government used 
general circulation model (GCM) simulations 
taken from the international Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to 
project future climate conditions in the broad 
geographic region encompassing the Samoan 
islands. Average annual air temperature at Apia 
in the Independent State of Sāmoa, 78 miles 
northwest of Pago Pago, is expected to rise by 
1.8–3.4°F (1–1.9°C) by 2050 under the higher 
scenario (RCP 8.5, that assumes a business-
as-usual future development path with no 
major policy changes to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions) and by 1.3–2.5°F (0.7–1.4°C) under 
the lower scenario (RCP 4.5, that is based on 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions to be about 
85% lower than the high scenario by the end 
of the 21st century) (Australian BOM and 
CSIRO 2014). There is very high confidence 
that air temperatures will rise, but medium

Ocean changes – The region was mostly free 
from long-lasting severe bleaching stress during 
the first half of the assessment period. Using 
NOAA Coral Reef Watch satellite data, a shift 
in the regime of bleaching heat stress seems to 
occur around 2001. Whereas no years prior to 
2000 recorded heat stress at Alert Level 1 or 
higher for 90% of reef grids, 9 of the most recent 
16 years had >90% of the reef grids exposed 
to Alert Levels 1 or 2 (and 7 of those years had 
100% exposure). See Fig. 6.2 in Marra and 
Kruk 2017 (Average Sea Surface Temperature 
Anomaly for the central South Pacific). There 
was local bleaching recorded in 1994 (Goreau 
and Hays 1995), demonstrating that local heat 
stress conditions may not always correspond to 
satellite monitored ocean temperatures. There 
is very high confidence in the increased risk of 
coral bleaching as the ocean warms, and medium 
confidence in the projected rate of change for the 
waters around Sāmoa because there is medium 
confidence in the rate of change of SST, and the 
changes at the reef scale (which can play a 
role in modulating large-scale changes) are 
not adequately resolved (Australian BOM and 
CSIRO 2014).

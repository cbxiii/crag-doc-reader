If you are a coastal infrastructure decision-maker… 
• 
Prepare for more frequent coastal flooding 
and increased erosion to affect coastal 
villages and infrastructure. Both sea level 
rise and more frequent and intense heavy 
rainfall events will produce flooding along 
the coasts of American Sāmoa. The majority 
of the Territory’s villages and infrastructure 
are located on the floodplains of Tutuila—
including the hospital and international 
airport. Coastal roads impacted by floods 
and landslides slow the transport of goods 
and limit access to health care. American 
Sāmoa is particularly vulnerable to coastal 
erosion where there are both narrow 
fringing reefs and only thin bands of land 
available for coastal infrastructure, though 
Tutuila is less at risk than Ofu-Olosega 
and Ta‘ū. Furthermore, “maladaptation” is 
occurring. For instance, seawalls are built 
with the intention of reducing erosion, but 
often have the unintended consequence of 
causing beach loss at other locations along 
the shore, worsening the erosion problem. 
Coral reefs already protect 435 buildings 
valued at over $46.5 million in American 
Sāmoa from floods that would result from a 
10-year storm event (Storlazzi et al. 2019). 
Prioritizing reef conservation and facili­
tating replanting of mangroves provides 
additional coastal protection (Ferrario et 
al. 2014). Stream restoration is another 
nature-based solution that can slow the

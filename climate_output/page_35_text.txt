Effects of Extreme Weather & Climate Change on Key Sectors   
US Coast Guard personnel observed a diversion boom placed in waterways in and around Leone
Bay to protect environmentally sensitive areas from any potential release of pollution from an
88-foot commercial fishing vessel, Chui Zai Fa No. 1, that was grounded in American Sa-moa 
during Cyclone Gita. US Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Tara Molle/Released,

• 
Expect reduced available catch for 
subsistence and commercial fishing. 
Climate change and ocean acidification are 
expected to cause coral reef fish to decline 
20% by 2050 (Bell et al. 2013). Fishing and 
exploitation of coral reef resources are 
expected to further exacerbate the effects 
on reef fish populations (Cheng and Gaskin 
2011). Rapidly changing conditions also 
affect open ocean fisheries and declines in 
maximum potential catch of more than 50% 
are projected under a business-as-usual 
scenario by 2100 for most of the islands in 
the Central and Western Pacific, including 
American Sāmoa (Asch et al. 2018; Bell et 
al. 2013). Increased drought and declines 
in potential catch could both have negative 
impacts on StarKist Samoa Tuna Cannery 
operations in Pago Pago, which traditionally 
has employed more than 1,500 workers 
(Frazier et al. 2019).
• 
Expect increased temperatures to 
negatively affect aquaculture. There are 
about 25 tilapia farms on Tutuila that are 
used for subsistence purposes. Tilapia 
aquaculture in American Sāmoa already 
exists at the upper limit of the temperature 
threshold. With the minimum expected 
temperature rise, fry (juvenile fish) will die 
and stocks will decrease in the absence of 
modifications to control water temperatures 
(personal communication, Kelley Anderson 
Tagarino, 2019).

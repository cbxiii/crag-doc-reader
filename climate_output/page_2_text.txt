The Center’s 21-acre Honolulu campus, adjacent to the University of Hawai‘i at 
Ma-noa, is located midway between Asia and the US mainland and features research, 
residential, and international conference facilities. The Center’s Washington, DC, 
office focuses on preparing the United States for an era of growing Asia Pacific 
prominence.
The East-West Center hosts the core office of the Pacific RISA grant, providing 
administrative and research capabilities for the program. The Pacific RISA is one 
of the 11 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Regional 
Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) teams that conduct research that builds 
the nation’s capacity to prepare for and adapt to climate variability and change. 
This work is supported by funding from NOAA. The Pacific RISA provided primary 
oversight of this and the 2012 PIRCA report.

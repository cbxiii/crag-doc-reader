Effects of Extreme Weather & Climate Change on Key Sectors   
• 
Expect hotter conditions to increase water 
demand and decrease available fresh water. 
Rising temperatures will increase evapo­
transpiration. The increased rate of water 
evaporation from soils, plants, wetlands, and 
streams means less water will be available 
to replenish groundwater aquifers. While 
changes in future rainfall amounts are 
uncertain, extreme rainfall is projected to 
increase and is more likely to run off into the 
ocean, rather than recharging groundwater. 
At the same time, rising temperatures increase 
the human population’s demand for water. 
• 
Energy consumption is projected to 
increase, driven by a combination of hotter 
weather and increasing population. Energy 
is used to pump and distribute water for use 
in households, agriculture, and industries. 
Increased hot days will generally increase 
the need for water and its loss through evap­
oration. Thus, a greater amount of energy 
is expected to be required to pump and 
distribute water (Gingerich et al. 2019) and 
cool homes on hot days in the future. While 
the population of American Sāmoa decreased 
from 2000 to 2010, approximately one-third 
of the population is below 15 years of age and 
may produce significant population growth, 
possibly increasing the demand for water 
and electricity (HHF Planners and USACE 
2020; Wendt et al. 2019). On the other hand, 
the small islands in American Sāmoa such as 
Manu‘a have lost half their population over 
the past several decades, and may continue 
along this trajectory. 
• 
Monitor ENSO and its effects on rainfall. 
The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
strongly influences rainfall amounts, which 
vary greatly from year to year in American 
Sāmoa. Although the relationship is complex 
and variable, El Niño events typically bring 
dry weather to the Samoan region in the 
following spring and summer, and a strong El 
Niño can cause severe local drought (Fig. 10). 
Water managers can use seasonal forecasts 
to prepare for potential water shortages or 
saltwater intrusion during drought years.

 Indicators of Climate Change in American Sa-moa
Cyclones and tropical storms (referred to 
collectively as tropical cyclones) bring intense 
winds, torrential rainfall, high waves, and storm 
surge to islands near their path. The effects 
of a tropical cyclone strike or near miss can 
severely impact lives and property. As defined 
by the US National Weather Service, cyclones 
generally occur between November and April 
in American Sāmoa, and the risk of tropical 
storms and cyclones increases during medium-
to-strong El Niño events. The southwest Pacific 
over the short-term has seen below-average 
tropical cyclone activity from 2010 to 2015 
compared to the 30-year normal (1981–2010) 
(Marra and Kruk 2017; Knapp et al. 2010); 
however, ENSO events during the period of 
record may have obscured long-term trends. 
There is scientific consensus that the intensity 
of tropical cyclones is likely to increase in a 
warmer world due to the increase in sea surface 
temperatures (USGCRP 2017; Marra and Kruk 
2017; Knutson et al. 2015; Sobel et al. 2016; 
Zhang et al. 2016; Zhang and Wang 2017; Wang 
et al. 2016; Widlansky et al. 2019). Basins that 
warm more than the tropical average will show 
the largest increases. The change in tropical 
cyclone intensity is projected to affect stronger 
storms the most (in other words, increased 
maximum intensities), which would amplify

The frequency and duration of drought is 
expected to remain approximately the same in 
the future. In American Sāmoa and the Inde­
pendent State of Sāmoa, long-term records show 
no significant trends in consecutive dry days 
(Australian BOM and CSIRO 2014; Wimhurst 
and Greene 2021). ENSO effects on drought in 
American Sāmoa vary with the strength of the 
event. During strong El Niño events, the islands 
are significantly drier; during weak El Niño 
events, reduced tropical storm activity causes 
conditions that are drier than average. 
Streamflow records available for American 
Sāmoa are relatively short and discontinuous, 
and only one stream gauge has more than 35 
years of record and is unaffected by artificial 
diversions (Keener et al. 2012). The Atauloma 
Stream gauge on the island of Tutuila showed 
a slight and insignificant downward trend from 
1959 to 1997 (Keener et al. 2012). Projected 
rainfall increases may cause both increased 
streamflow and runoff relative to historic levels 
(Shuler et al. 2021).

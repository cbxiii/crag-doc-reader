Table 4 provides a list of all the coral genera (with acronym) recorded in the survey sites in 
2015. The topmost abundant coral taxa present are in bold.

Regardless of bleaching, coral assemblage varied with depth, and the pattern was not necessarily 
the same between sectors. At the NE and SE sectors around Tutuila, most of the coral genera 
present were the same in the shallow and middle reefs; they were also present in the deep reefs, 
along with additional genera. In the SW Sector (of Fagatele), the coral genera in the deep reefs 
varied from the middle and shallow reefs, with some overlap in genera between the shallow and 
middle reefs. At this location, the shallow reefs also had quite a few genera not found in either 
the middle or deep reefs. Coral assemblage varied with sector for all depths, although there was 
more overlap in coral genera in the middle reefs. 
Spatial patterns of bleaching prevalence dominant hard coral taxa  
In general, the percentage of coral colonies that bleached was fairly low for all dominant coral 
genera (Figure 9). This is likely due to the ecological surveys being conducted early on in the

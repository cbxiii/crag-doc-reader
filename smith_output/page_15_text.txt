Statistical analysis 
Time series analysis and temperature trend 
As previously described, temperature time series analysis was conducted via detrended 
fluctuation analysis (DFA). DFAs were applied to all additive time series models, and 
temperature time series were decomposed for trends, seasonality (daily, weekly, annual), and 
remainder (i.e., error). All DFAs were conducted in R version 4.0.3 using the ‘mstl’ function in 
the R package ‘forecast’. Since temperature data were recorded hourly, the seasonality variables 
set in each model were defined as 24, 168, and 8,766 for daily, weekly, and yearly periodicity. 
The time series analysis identified years that were warmer than the previous years, and they were 
identified as having a warming trend.  
Heat stress metrics from full temperature time series (2012–2018) 
A series of generalized linear models (GLMs) were applied to the heating metrics to determine if 
they varied by site, depth, or years. Specifically, GLMs with a binomial distribution and logit 
link were applied to test for differences in presence/absence of acute and cumulative heat stress 
events between site, depth, and year. GLMs with a Gaussian distribution and identity function 
tested for differences in heating rates between sites, depth, and years. Additionally, GLMs with a 
gamma distribution and log link function were used to determine if daily temperature ranges 
were significantly different between sites, depths, years, months, and heating versus cooling 
seasons. GLMs with a Gaussian distribution and identity link function were applied to test for 
differences in CV values between site, depth, year, and warming versus cooling seasons 
For all GLMs, model assumptions of independence, homogeneity of variance, and normality of 
error were evaluated through diagnostic leverage, Cook’s distance, dfbetas (Cohen and Cohen

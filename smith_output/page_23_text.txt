Table 3. Generalized linear model results (F and p-values) examining the spatial differences in 
heating metrics across site, depth, and the interaction between site and depth just for the 2014-2015 
period when the massive bleaching event occurred in American Samoa. Heating metrics include 
cumulative heat stress (long-term accumulated time above the temperature bleaching threshold), 
acute heat stress (short-term spike in temperature above the bleaching threshold), warming trend, 
heating rates, and measures of temperature variability

Cumulative heating 
(a) Full time series (2012â€“2018) 
Cumulative stress (i.e., depth-corrected DHW) varied significantly by year (p < 0.001) and was 
only detected in 2015 and 2017 (Figure 5; shows only the NE site which has the longest 
temperature time series data available). For the years DHW was present, it also varied to a lesser 
extent by depth (p < 0.001) with shallow reefs having slightly higher cumulated heat stress, and 
site, with the Southwest sector experiencing slightly higher levels of cumulated stress.

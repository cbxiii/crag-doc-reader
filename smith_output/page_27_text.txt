Figure 6. Periodograms of power spectral density analysis applied to all sites at each depth show the 
frequencies at which high variation in the temperature time series occurred. The frequency y-axis 
for the periodograms were converted to cycles per unit time by extracting the frequency data from 
the PSD and dividing by the length of the sample interval. The spectral density was then multiplied 
by 2 so that the area under the curve of the periodogram equals the variance of the time series.

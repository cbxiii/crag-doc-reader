Cross-correlation analysis 
Temperature time series were highly correlated when compared between sites and depths (Figure 
3). In fact, temperature patterns were nearly identical between shallow, middle, and deep reefs 
for the same site, especially at the Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, and Southeast Island sites 
where cross correlation values were all above 0.90 (i.e., at least 90% similar temperature time 
series between depths). No distinct geographic patterns were observed, except that the Northeast 
and Southeast sites were highly correlated for shallow, middle, and deep reefs (correlation 
coefficient = 0.80, 0.89, 0.89, respectively). Upon investigation for cross-correlations between 
sites that had correlation coefficients of ~0.50, the lower values were due to differences in time 
period (i.e., one logger may have only collected half the data), and when equal time periods were 
applied, then the time series were highly cross-correlated. Although temperature time series are 
shown to have similar patterns between sites and depth strata at the reefs around Tutuila, further 
analyses explored potential differences in variability and other metrics between sites and depths. 
Together, these results suggest that there is very little temperature structure across depth, and 
temperature patterns are fairly consistent even across a variety of oceanographic conditions at the 
island level.  
 
Figure 3. Cross-correlation matrix comparing temperature time series between sites for different 
depths. Scatterplots of two pairs of time series temperature values are plotted against each other 
and the estimated correlation is displayed in the counterpart matrix box. Red lines indicate the 
Lowess fit between two time series. Cross-correlations were made between sites (NW, N, NE, SW, 
SE, SE Island) for (a) shallow, (b) middle, and (c) deep reefs. No data were collected at the SE 
Island site for the shallow reefs.

Figure 4. Cross-correlation matrix comparing temperature time series between depth strata for all 
sites. Scatterplots of two pairs of time series temperature values are plotted against each other and 
the estimated correlation is displayed in the counterpart matrix box. Red lines indicate the Lowess 
fit between two time series. Cross-correlations were made between depth strata (shallow 5 m, 
middle 15 m, and deep 25 m) for six sites (NW, N, NE, SW, SE, SE Island) around Tutuila, 
American Samoa. No data were collected at the SE Island site for the shallow reefs. 
Heat stress metrics  
A summary of how the heating metrics varied by year, site, and depth for the full time series 
(years 2012â€“2018) can be found in Table 2. Furthermore, a summary of how the heating metrics 
varied by site and depth for the bleaching event of 2015 are found in Table 3.

also had increased bleaching prevalence due to cumulative and acute heat stress. Since these 
corals were some of the first genera to bleach, perhaps they can serve as forecasters of mass 
bleaching.  
The time series for in situ temperature data (2012â€“2018) will allow further studies to associate 
this with time series of ecological data instead of just a single time point for benthic data as was 
completed here. Matched temperature and ecological time series data would help illuminate the 
full extent to which the benthos is impacted by vertical thermal structure through time and 
changing temperature. 
The long-term in situ temperature data collected at these reefs provide detailed information on 
multiple types of heat stress to which reefs throughout Tutuila have been exposed throughout 
time. These heating metrics could be combined with other anthropogenic stressors to the reefs, 
like carbonate chemistry variables indexing ocean acidification, and measured variables of water 
quality to determine how multi-stressors may impact reef communities over time. Urgent effort 
at the global scale is needed to combat climate change, but local efforts of monitoring can be 
used to prevent or lessen coral reef loss.

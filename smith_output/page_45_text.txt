• Bleaching prevalence was significantly impacted by the interaction of both depth and 
sector for Galaxea. 
Summary of results linking heating parameters of 2015 to coral bleaching: 
• Temperature variability (daily temperature range for the warming season of 2014–2015) 
was the only heat stress type that influenced the bleaching prevalence of all hard corals. 
• All heating rates were high in the 2014–2015 year, but heating rate did not vary between 
site or depth. Thus, heating rate has no detectable impact on bleaching prevalence for 
coral when examining data for just one year. In other words, heating rates vary with time, 
but we have spatial, not temporal, data for bleaching prevalence; thus, heating rates 
appear to have no influence on the bleaching prevalence.  
• Cumulative heat stress, acute heat stress, and temperature variability impacted the 
bleaching prevalence of a few coral genera. 
• Since the ecological surveys were conducted at the beginning of the bleaching event, this 
may indicate that Leptastrea and Monastrea were the first coral genera to react to heat 
stress. 
• The mean daily temperature range was the primary variability parameter that was best 
linked to changes in bleaching prevalence of corals. 
• Despite many of the variability metrics varying between site and depth, this does not 
seem to the best predictor for bleaching prevalence

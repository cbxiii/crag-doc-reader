• When acute stress was measured in hours above the bleaching threshold (sometimes 
lasting over a few days), then the Southeast site had more hours above the threshold, 
while all the other sites experienced relatively equal hours above the bleaching threshold.  
• The Southeast site experienced more hours above the threshold because it experienced 
two acute heat stress events; meanwhile, all other sites each experienced only one acute 
stress event. 
• The two acute heat stress events occurred in the shallow reefs and not the mid or deep 
reefs. 
Heating rates 
• Heating rates did not vary by site or by depth 
Variability 
• Tides (measured by peak is PSD at 12 hr) have similar influence on reefs at all sites and 
depths. 
• Daily fluctuations (measured by peak in PSD at 24 hr) are greater at shallow depths 
compared to the mid and deep reefs, and Southwest Fagatele has greater daily 
fluctuations than the other sites. 
• Internal tides (measured by peak at the PSD at 48 hr) occur more at the deep reefs 
compared to the mid and shallow reefs, and the site at Southwest in Fagatele Bay are 
exposed to more internal waves. 
• For the warming period prior to the massive bleaching event, daily temperature ranges 
varied between site and depth. Unexpectedly, the deeper reefs experienced greater daily 
temperature ranges than the shallow reefs. Also, Southeast Island Aunuu experienced 
high daily temperature ranges, while the Southeast experience lower daily temperature 
ranges. 
• Daily temperature means and ranges 30 days prior to the ecological survey date varied 
between site and depth as well as day, since the ecological surveys were conducted on 
different days over a month-long period. 
Summary of results for coral bleaching: 
• In general, bleaching prevalence was fairly low for all dominant coral genera. This is 
likely due to the ecological surveys being conducted in the early days of the bleaching 
event.  
• Bleaching prevalence varied by depth for all hard corals. 
• It appears that the bleaching prevalence of most of the dominant coral genera did not vary 
by depth, so the overall trend of hard corals was driven by a few genera (Leptastrea and 
Monastrea).  
• Since the ecological surveys were conducted at the beginning of the bleaching event, this 
may suggest that Leptastrea and Monastrea were the first two coral genera to react to 
heat stress. 
• Bleaching prevalence did not differ across sectors, except for Pocillopora.

Key Findings 
The time series analysis revealed a few key patterns: 
• Overall patterns in each time series data were similar between site and depth.  
• Acute heat stress (spikes in temperature for a few days) occurred in austral summers of 
2015, 2016, and 2017 for most sites at all depths. The acute heat stress also occurred in 
2018 for the middle and deep reefs, but not for the shallow reefs.  
• For all sites and depths, the overall trend is that temperature is increasing through time, 
with the exception of 2016 and 2018.  
• Daily temperature variability is only high while waters are warm. The highest daily 
ranges only occur for a few days and coincide with the acute heat stress period.  
• Weekly measurements indicate that the biggest variability in temperature occurs in the 
few weeks prior to the highest seasonal temperatures reached each year. In other words, 
daily variability is already greater during warming, but the first few weeks of the 
warming season start with low variability. However, at the end of the heating season, the 
week-to-week variability is highest right before the peak seasonal temperature is met. 
This was true for 2013–2016, but not for 2017 or 2018.  
• When looking at the periodicity due to yearly cycles, every singly annual pattern has a 
double high peak in which there is an initial heating rate increase, followed by a slight 
decrease, and then another increase in temperatures during the warming period. 
• Temperature time series were highly correlated when compared between sites. 
• No distinct geographic patterns were observed, except that the Northeast and Southeast 
sites were highly correlated for shallow, middle, and deep reefs (correlation coefficient = 
0.80, 0.89, 0.89, respectively).  
• Temperature patterns were nearly identical between shallow, middle, and deep reefs for 
the same site, especially at the Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, and Southeast Island 
sites where cross correlation values were all above 0.90 (i.e., at least 90% similar 
temperature time series between depths). 
Summary of results for heating parameters calculated for the entire temperature time 
series (2012–2018): 
Cumulative heat stress 
• Cumulative heat stress (DHW) varied primarily through time (years) and less so spatially 
(little difference between sites).  
• Cumulative heat stress impacted reefs at all sites and at all depths. Shallow and middle 
reefs had more cumulative heat than the deeper reefs, but the deeper reefs still 
experienced cumulative heat stress. 
Acute heat stress 
• The presence or absence of acute heat stress was significantly different between years 
(p(1,6) < 0.05), but not between sites (p(1,2) = 0.17) or depth (p(2,0.4) = 0.81).

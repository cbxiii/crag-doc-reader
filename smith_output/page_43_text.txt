(2) Daily temperature ranges  
• Daily temperature ranges were significantly different (p(df,F) = values) between depth 
(p(2,127) < 0.001), year (p(5,238) < 0.001), periods of heating versus cooling (p(1,2982) <0.001), 
and site(p(5,393) < 0.001).  
• Temperature ranges were more variable during the heating part than the cooling periods, 
with the greatest temperature ranges observed in the austral summer months of January, 
February, and March.  
• Unexpectedly, the deeper reefs experienced the greatest temperature ranges, not the 
shallow reefs.  
• There were significant differences between sites; the reefs at Southwest Fagatele had 
higher daily temperature ranges than the other sites, but there was no apparent spatial 
pattern.  
• Daily temperature ranges were also statistically different between years, but there was no 
relationship between daily temperature ranges and the massive bleaching events since the 
2014–2015 year had high temperature variability in daily temperature, but the 2016–2017 
year did not. 
(3) The coefficient of variation (CV)  
• Coefficient of variation (CV) values differed significantly between sites (p(5,8) < 0.001), 
depth (p(2,6) < 0.01), and year (p(5,4) < 0.01), but not between warming and cooling 
seasons (p(1,0.009) = 0.93). 
• The interactive effect between sites, depth, and year was also significant (p(20,2) < 0.01). 
Due to the interaction effect, no consistent pattern was evident between sites and years.  
• Deep reefs varied more from their long-term mean compared to the middle and shallow 
reefs. 
•  On average, deep reefs vary ±72.3% from their long term mean temperature, whereas 
mid and shallow reefs vary ±63.8% and ±62.0%, respectively, from their long term 
temperature. 
Summary of heating metrics just for the bleaching event of 2015: 
Cumulative heat stress 
• All reefs at all sites and depths experienced cumulative heat stress events. 
• When the values of degree heating week (DHW) were compared between sites, the 
Southeast site had slightly more cumulative stress than the other sites, which all had 
similar cumulative heat stress exposure to each other. 
• When the values of degree heating week (DHW) were compared between depths, the 
shallow reefs experienced higher values of DHW while the mid and shallow reefs were 
exposed to similar levels of DHW. 
Acute heat stress 
• All reefs at all sites and depths experienced acute stress events in 2015.

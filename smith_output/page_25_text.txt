Acute heat stress 
(a) Full time series (2012–2018) 
The presence or absence of acute heat stress was significantly different between years (p(1,6) = 
0.02), but not between sites (p(1,2) = 0.21) or depth (p(2,0.17) = 0.84); acute stress events occurred 
primarily in the austral summer months of 2015, 2016, and 2017. However, when the number of 
hours above the threshold were evaluated, acute stress did vary spatially with shallow reefs 
experiencing slightly longer acute stress events (up to 52 hours of an acute heat stress in the 
shallow reefs compared to only a few hours (< 10 hr) in the deeper middle and deep reefs). 
Furthermore, the Southeast sector of Tutuila experienced slightly longer acute heat stress events 
than the other sectors (average acute heat stress event lasted 27 hours in the SE Sector, while the 
SW, NW, and NE Sectors experienced acute heat events that lasted an average of 19, 13, and 10 
hours, respectively). Also, the number of acute stress events that occurred varied; one event 
occurred in 2015 and 2016, and three events occurred in the summer months of 2017.  
(b) Bleaching year (2015) 
All reefs at all sites and depths experienced acute stress events in 2015. The Southeast site had 
more hours above the threshold, while all the other sites experienced relatively equal hours 
above the bleaching threshold. The Southeast site in Fagatele Bay, experienced more hours of 
intense short-term heat because there were two acute heat stress events while only one event 
occurred at. The two acute heat stress events occurred in the shallow reefs and not the mid or 
deep reefs. 
Heating rates 
(a) Full time series (2012–2018) 
Heating rates were significantly different between depths (p(2,4) = 0.02) with shallow reefs 
generally warming more rapidly than mid and deep reefs. Heating rates were also significantly 
different between years (p(5,10) < 0.001), with the heating rate increasing each year except in 
2018. In 2017, seawater temperature rose rapidly in the first few weeks of the warming season, 
and then continued to warm but at a slightly slower rate (Figure 2a). 
(b) Bleaching year (2015) 
Heating rates did not vary by site nor by depth for this one year. Heating rates in 2015 were 
greater than heating rates in 2014. 
Temperature variability 
(a) Full time series (2012–2018) 
The power spectral density analysis showed that high temperature variation (i.e., peaks in the 
dendrograms) occurred at multiple frequencies (Figure 6). The PSD also revealed that reefs at 
different depths exhibit different drivers for temperature variation. Expectedly, 24 diurnal light 
cycles was a significant peak for all three depths, especially in the shallow waters where the 
strongest frequency for both warming and cooling seasons was at 24 hours. The PSD also 
allowed us to observe the influence of tides on the reefs at each depth, with semidiurnal tides

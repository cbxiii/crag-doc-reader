Figure 5. Bleaching thresholds (MMM+1) applied to temperature time series for shallow, mid, and 
deep reefs at the Northeast site. Bleaching was observed in the austral summers of 2015 and 2017. 
(b) Bleaching year (2015) 
All reefs at all sites and depths experienced cumulative heat stress events (measured as depth-
corrected DHW). When the values of depth-corrected degree heating weeks (DHW) were 
compared between sites, the Southwest site in Fagatele Bay had slightly more cumulative stress 
than the other sites. All of the other sites had similar cumulative heat stress exposure to each 
other. When the values of DHW were compared between depths, then the shallow reefs 
experienced higher values while the mid and shallow reefs were exposed to similar levels of 
DHW.

• Acute stress events primarily occurred in the austral summer months of 2015, 2016, and 
2017.  
• One acute stress event occurred both in 2015 and 2016, while three acute stress events 
occurred in the summer months of 2017. 
Heating rates 
• Heating rates were significantly different between depths (p(2,4) < 0.05). 
• Shallow reefs generally warm at a faster rate than mid and deep reefs. 
• Heating rates were also significantly different between years (p(5,10) < 0.001).  
• Heating rate progressively increased each year except in 2018. 
• Seawater temperature steadily increased throughout each warming season, except in 2017 
when seawater warmed rapidly in the first few weeks, and then continued to warm but at 
a slightly slower rate.  
Temperature variability 
(1) Power spectral density (PSD)  
• The power spectral density analysis showed that high temperature variation, i.e., peaks in 
the dendrograms, occurs at multiple frequencies, 
• The PSD also revealed that reefs at different depths exhibit different drivers for 
temperature variation.  
• Expectedly, diurnal temperature cycles drive most of the temperature variability in the 
shallow reefs for both warming and cooling seasons.  
• The PSD also allowed us to observe the influence of tides on the reefs at each depth; 
semidiurnal tides occur every 12 hours and influence the water temperature at all reefs 
and at all depths but become increasingly important with depth. 
• In the shallow reefs the diurnal cycle has a stronger influence on temperature variation 
than semidiurnal tides.  
• At some mid water reefs (at North, Northeast, and Southeast Island sites), the diurnal 
daylight cycles and semidiurnal tides have almost a similar influence on the temperature 
variation, i.e., 24 hr and 12 hr frequency peaks are nearly the same height during the 
warming season.  
• Interestingly, the deep reef sites are influenced by a third driver of temperature variation, 
internal waves occur every 48 hours. Shallow and middle reefs are not exposed to these 
waves.  
• Deep reefs at all sites except the North site were exposed to internal waves that 
influenced the variability in temperature.  
• The internal waves only appear during the warming season and are not detectable during 
the cooling months.

Methods 
Subsurface temperature recorders (STR) were deployed at 6 sites and at 3 depths through 
NOAA’s Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program from 2012 to 2018. We performed a 
time series analysis on the in situ temperature data using the following steps: 
1. Applied the time series analysis to determine trends and associated periodicities that may 
be drivers of mass bleaching events.  
2. Compared the temperature time series between sites and depth strata to observe any 
potential differences in temporal patterns.  
3. Calculated multiple metrics for five heat stress types: cumulative heat stress, acute heat 
stress, heating rates, trends, and temperature variability. 
During the deployment of the STR time series (2012–2018), two massive bleaching events 
occurred during the austral summer months of 2015 and 2017. Unfortunately, the extent of 
bleaching during peak thermal stress was not quantitatively measured for either year. However, 
the beginning of bleaching in 2015 happened to occur during the regularly scheduled monitoring 
surveys. Thus, we assessed the relationship between thermal stress metrics and bleaching 
prevalence at the beginning of the 2015 bleaching event through the following steps:  
4. Determined the spatial variation in heating metrics between sites and depths calculated 
just for the 2015 period when the mass bleaching event occurred.  
5. Determined if bleaching prevalence of hard corals varied between depth (shallow: 0–6 m, 
middle: 6–18 m, and deep: 18–25 m) and island sector (northeast, northwest, southeast, 
southwest)).  
6. Determined if bleaching prevalence of hard corals and dominant coral genera varied with 
heating metrics from the 2014–2015 heating period. 
In situ temperature recorder deployment 
Sea-Bird SBE56 temperature sensors were deployed in 4 sectors (Northwest, Northeast, 
Southwest, Southeast) circumnavigating Tutuila, American Samoa, at multiple sites at three 
different depths (5 m, 15 m, and 25 m) from 2012 through 2018. Two additional sites were added 
in 2015 for a total of 6 sites (Figure 1). Measurements were taken every 5 minutes and averaged 
per hour, resulting in hourly temperature data over 6 years.

bleaching event. These plots do not necessarily portray the full extent to which bleaching 
occurred in American Samoa the months after the surveys were conducted. 
 
Figure 9. Histogram of bleaching prevalence for the dominant coral taxa. 
The spatial variations between depth and sector in bleaching prevalence of all hard coral and 
dominant coral genera were explored through GAMLSS. Bleaching prevalence varied by depth 
for all hard corals (Table 5; Figure 10). It appears that the bleaching prevalence of most 
dominant coral genera did not vary by depth; the overall trend of hard corals was driven by a few 
genera (Leptastrea and Montastrea). Since the ecological surveys were conducted at the 
beginning of the bleaching event, this may suggest that Leptastrea and Montastrea were the first 
two coral genera to respond to heat stress. Bleaching prevalence did not differ across sectors in 
any taxa, except for Pocillopora which experienced the most bleaching in the Southwest Sector 
in Fagatele Bay. Bleaching prevalence was significantly impacted by the interaction of both 
depth and sector for Galaxea.

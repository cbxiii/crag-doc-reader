Our third kind of rail is a real mystery bird, as shown by the fact that it has no 
Samoan name.  In English it is called the Spotless Crake.  Although its wide 
range in the Pacific is very similar to the ve'a, in American Samoa it has only 
been sighted on the island of Ta'u.  The Spotless Crake is very small, only 
about half the size of a ve'a, and is all dark gray except for red legs and eyes.  
It lives in dense grass, almost never flies, and is active at dawn and dusk.  All 
this makes it a very hard bird to find.  In fact, only a single bird was seen by 
biologists in 1986, and another was sighted in 2001. 
  
There is one more kind of rail to mention, and this is the most mysterious Samoan bird of all.  It is the 
puna'e, or Samoan Woodhen.  This bird was first described by scientists in 1874, and last seen in 1908.  
In the whole world, only 11 preserved specimens of it exist.  It apparently occurred only on Savai'i in 
western Samoa. 
 
Old stories tell that the puna'e lived in burrows in the mountain forests, and that it was formerly so 
abundant that it was hunted with nets and dogs specially trained to tell which burrows were occupied.  If 
these stories are true, the puna'e was a very special bird indeed, since no other rails live in burrows.  In 
the last ten years, there has been an unconfirmed report of the puna'e being seen in the mountains of 
Savai'i.  These remote forests have been rarely visited by biologists, and we can hope that this unique 
bird may yet survive in the depths of that misty wilderness.

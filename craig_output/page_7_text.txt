Samoan Archipelago.  This chain of 13 Pacific islands (9 inhabited) plus two remote atolls is located 
140 south of the equator near the international date line.  It is divided into two political entities, 
the US Territory of American Samoa and the neighboring independent country of Samoa, 
formerly known as Western Samoa.  The youngest islands in this chain lie towards the east 
(Ta'u).  The land area of (western) Samoa (2934 km2, 1132 mi2) is approximately 15 times 
larger than the land area of American Samoa (197.1 km2, 76.1 mi2). 
 
Territory of American Samoa.  The total land area of 76.1 square miles (197.1 km2) includes five 
volcanic islands (Tutuila, Aunu'u, Ofu, Olosega, Ta'u) and two remote atolls (Rose, Swains). 
 
Population.  Polynesians arrived here about 3,000 years 
ago.  The current population (62,000 in 2005) is 
growing rapidly at about 1.8% per year, which 
equates to about 1,100 additional babies and 
immigrants per year.  Most people (96%) live on 
Tutuila Island.  The ethnic composition is 
approximately 90% Samoan, 4% Tongan,  2% 
Caucasian, and 4% others. 
 
Topography.  The main islands are steep mountains that 
emerge from the ocean floor 2-3 miles below the 
sea surface.  Peak elevations are 3,170 feet on 
Ta'u Island (Lata Mountain) and 2,142 feet on Tutuila Island (Matafao Peak). 
 
Climate.  Hot, humid and rainy year-round, but there is a long, wet summer season (October - May) and 
a slightly cooler and drier season (June - September).  Total rainfall is 125 inches at the Tafuna 
airport and 200+ inches in mountainous areas. 
 
Tropical cyclones (hurricanes).  While very destructive, cyclones are a 
natural but erratic feature of the environment in this part of the 
world.  The most recent ones in American Samoa have occurred at 
intervals of 1-13 years: 1981 Esau, 1987 Tusi, 1990 Ofa, 1991 
Val, 2004 Heta, 2005 Olaf. 
 
Native flora and fauna.  Most native species here are closely related to those in Indonesia, but due to 
our remote location in the Pacific Ocean, the diversity of terrestrial species here is low:  343 
flowering plants, 135 ferns, 25 resident or migratory land and water birds, 20 resident seabirds, 
3 mammals (all bats), 7 skinks, 4 geckos, 2 sea turtles, 1 snake, and other occasional visitors.  In 
contrast, the diversity of marine species here is high:  890 coral reef fishes, over 200 corals, and 
several whales and dolphins.  Insects and other invertebrate species here are not well known. 
 
Endemic species.  Species found only in the Samoan Archipelago include one bird (Samoan starling), 
one stream fish, several land snails, and about 30% of local plant species.  Five flowering plant 
species are endemic to American Samoa itself.  Marine endemics have not been 
identified, but a thorough investigation has not been conducted. 
 
Threatened or endangered species.  Federally listed species here include humpback and 
sperm whales, and the green and hawksbill sea turtles.  Additional species 'of

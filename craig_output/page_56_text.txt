A final note.  On rare occasions, sea snakes have been seen in our coastal waters.  One verified air-
breathing banded sea snake (probably Laticauda columbrina) was collected here in 2000.  However, 
most local sightings of “sea snakes” are actually fish (eels) that are very snake-like in appearance.  It 
would not be difficult to confuse the two:

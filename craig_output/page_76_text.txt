but island animals have nowhere else to go.  On larger islands like 
Upolu, Savai'i or Viti Levu, manuma may be able to travel long 
distances to get the food they like the best.  This may be difficult 
on small islands like those of American Samoa, and means that 
animals can only specialize on very reliable food trees such as 
banyan trees (aoa). 
 
These giant banyan trees, which are so important to manuma, face 
many problems of their own.  The Tafuna Plain used to have many 
huge banyans, but most of these have been cut down to make way 
for the exploding human populations in that area.  Moreover, 
banyans, with their large size and spreading crowns, are very 
vulnerable to storm damage.  Many were killed or severely 
damaged by Cyclones Ofa and Val in the early 1990s.  Even those 
that survived the cyclones had their leaves and fruit stripped off, 
leading to a prolonged period of famine for manuma. 
 
There are two things that must happen if the manuma is to survive 
and remain a special part of Samoa's wildlife.  First, the birds must 
be protected from hunting.  Although the manuma is too rare to be 
sought by hunters, a few may have been killed every year by 
hunters out for lupe and manutagi.  When a population is as small 
as the manuma's, even a few preventable deaths per year are a 
significant problem. 
 
The second thing that must be done if the manuma is to survive is 
to protect banyan trees on which they depend.  Without enough banyans to assure a year-round supply 
of its favorite food, the manuma may well become extinct on Tutuila.  People need to protect these 
magnificent trees, which are important food sources for many other Samoan wildlife species, including 
the fruit bats (flying foxes).

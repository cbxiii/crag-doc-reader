The Sheath-tailed Bat (Emballonura semicaudata) also feeds on 
mosquitoes and other flying insects.  But unlike the swift, this small bat 
does not seem to accept sheltered cliffs as roosting or breeding areas, 
inhabiting only deep and protected caves.  There are few such caves in 
American Samoa, and therefore few good homes for the bat.  Ever since 
Cyclone Ofa in 1990, the known bat caves on Tutuila have been almost 
deserted.  Cyclones Ofa and Val swept water and debris into several 
caves, and the days of strong cyclone winds may have made it impossible 
for the bats to find food.  Unless more bats survive in caves that we don't 
know about, the long-term survival of this useful and fascinating animal 
in American Samoa is doubtful.  There is little we can do to help the bat 
except to stay away from their caves to avoid disturbing the few surviving 
animals.  Sadly, the Sheath-tailed Bat seems to be endangered throughout 
most of its range, including in western Samoa and the Marianas, as well 
as here. 
 
And what about the swift?  Although the 
population of these birds was reduced by 
cyclones in 1990-91, the species seems to 
be in no danger of extinction.  It is still 
possible to see flocks of hundreds of 
swifts swirling together in areas where 
winds collect large numbers of insects, for 
example in Malaeimi Valley and in such 
highland areas as Aoloau and Afono Pass.  
There is every reason to believe that these 
birds will always enliven the Samoan sky 
-- and strike terror into the hearts of 
mosquitoes everywhere.

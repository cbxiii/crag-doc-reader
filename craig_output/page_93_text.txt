brown and black pattern on the wings.  Black Noddies are more often seen feeding in flocks with manu 
sina than are Brown Noddies.  The diet of the gogo is apparently similar to that of the manu sina, since 
both birds feed on small fish and squid captured near the surface.  How do different birds with such 
similar food habits coexist?  Maybe each catches just a particular kind or size of fish, or dives to a 
certain depth. 
 
One of the most interesting sights in American Samoa is a foraging flock of seabirds.  These groups can 
have from five or ten to hundreds of birds.  They are a great chance to see the many different ways 
seabirds catch fish:  laia flutter above the waves, sometimes dangling their feet into the water, gogo 
swoop low over the water, fua'o dive into the water with a huge splash, and atafa wait until a fua'o 
catches some fish, then chase it and take the fish from it.  The birds you see in such a flock are a good 
indication of which fish are below the water, something Samoan fishermen use to locate schools of fish.  
A flock of small birds like White Terns and Black Noddies usually indicates skipjack or small tuna, 
while large flocks of fua'o indicate larger fish. 
 
As fishing partners or simply as beautiful neighbors on our islands, Samoa's seabirds are a special part of 
our wild heritage.

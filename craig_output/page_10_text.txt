But if it feels like our climate it is getting warmer, it 
is, but the picture is a little complicated.  We have two 
long-term records of air temperature in American 
Samoa, the NOAA weather stations at the Tafuna 
airport and at Tula.  Temperature trends at these two 
sites are quite different, probably due to local 
conditions where the temperatures are actually 
measured.  Temperatures measured at the airport 
weather station have risen steadily over the past 20 
years (see graph), but no such increase has been 
recorded at the NOAA station in Tula.  The airport 
station measures air temperatures at a height of about 
5.5 feet above the ground, and it is located on the 
Tafuna Plains which is rapidly being built up with 
buildings and roads, so it is probably detecting a near-
ground increase in temperature that is felt by us.  
Whether other parts of Tutuila are warming in a 
similar fashion is not known.  In contrast, the Tula 
station is on the upwind side of the island and it measures air temperatures at 50 feet above the ground, 
so it is less affected by near-ground conditions.  It shows no increase in temperature, as would be 
expected at our remote oceanic location. 
 
As summer progresses, the temperature of the 
ocean’s surface waters also increases by about 30 F.  
Warmer ocean temperatures, in turn, help provide 
the energy to start tropical cyclones, thus the chance 
of a cyclone is greatest between November and 
April. 
 
Tropical cyclones have hit American Samoa at 
intervals of 1-13 years during the past 24 years: 
1981 Esau, 1987 Tusi, 1990 Ofa, 1991 Val, 2004 
Heta and 2005 Olaf.  Their severity varied -- Tusi was particularly damaging to Manu’a, the back-to-
back cyclones Ofa and Val hit Tutuila hard, Heta’s overall impact was moderate, Olaf slammed Manu’a 
hard. 
 
A world map of cyclone tracks (next page) 
helps put some perspective on American 
Samoa’s susceptibility to tropical cyclones.  
This map shows the tracks of all cyclones 
greater than 74 mph during the 10-year 
period 1994-2003.  It shows that cyclones 
are generated primarily in two bands that lie 
north and south of the earth’s equator at 
latitudes of about 10-300.  American Samoa 
lies near the edge of the cyclone band in the 
southern hemisphere where cyclone activity 
begins to fade.

tree limb.  You may also hear its call, a single, drawn-out coo that is slightly lower and much longer 
than the rapid, short coos of the fruit-doves manutagi or manuma.  If you are very close, you can hear a 
slight variation in the tone of the call.  Tuaimeo are mostly dark brown birds, although like many doves 
the males can be very pretty if seen in good light.  Unlike 
other doves or pigeons in American Samoa, this bird spends 
most of its time on the ground, where it feeds on fallen seeds, 
fruit, and buds.  Tuaimeo can be seen on Ofu and Olosega, as 
well as in Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa.  
 
Birds are not the only unique wildlife of Manu'a.  For 
example, Ta'u is home to American Samoa's only native 
snake, the gata, or Pacific Boa.  This dark brown snake is 
harmless to people, apparently living mostly on a diet of lizards (mo'o and pili), birds and bird eggs.  It 
is rare, or at least very hard to find in the deep forests of Ta'u, and should be left undisturbed whenever 
it is found. 
 
Why is the wildlife in Manu'a so different from that on Tutuila?  One reason could be the wildness of 
Manu'a:  large areas, mostly on Ta'u, are untouched by villages, plantations, and roads.  Another reason 
may be that in Manu'a the native birds have fewer problems caused by introduced birds, animals, 
diseases, or plants.  Or, it could be that the terrain in Manu'a, which has many areas with steep yet 
forested ridges that have quite different plants than similar ridges, such as Alava, on Tutuila.  Each of 
the special birds of Manu'a may have different reasons for being there, but the absence of all of them 
from Tutuila suggests there might be a single explanation for this pattern, and this remains an interesting 
biological question about American Samoa.

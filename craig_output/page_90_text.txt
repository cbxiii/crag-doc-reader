All these tuli can usually be seen in such places as Sliding Rock and Pala Lagoon from September to 
April.  But in April/May, all but a few stragglers will have left Samoa to take their long, long trip back 
to Alaska.  So, the next time you see some tuli, wish them a safe journey and try to imagine, maybe with 
a little envy, their great adventure.

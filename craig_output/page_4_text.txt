NATURAL HISTORY GUIDE

This collection of articles provides a glimpse into the marine and wildlife resources in American 
Samoa's tropical, oceanic environment.  The articles were written biologists at the Department of 
Marine & Wildlife Resources (DMWR), National Park of American Samoa (NPS), Land Grant Program 
at the American Samoa Community College (ASCC), and University of Hawaii (UH).  Our purpose in 
writing was to make the results of our studies available to teachers, students, visitors and whoever else 
might be curious about Samoa's environment.  The use of English, Samoan and scientific names of 
plants and animals varies among chapters, so the reader is referred to cross-referenced lists in the 
species checklists and the plant index at the end of this report (Appendix 2).  
  
Several individuals, organizations and publishers kindly allowed their illustrations to be reprinted in this 
volume; their credits are listed in Appendix 2.  Special thanks to Dick Watling for permission to 
reproduce the excellent pictures from his books “Birds of Fiji, Tonga and Samoa” and “Birds of Fiji and 
Western Polynesia” (Pacificbirds.com).   
 
Joshua Seamon, Matt Le'i, Larry Basch and Tavita Togia provided comments throughout the text, and 
Tavita Togia and Art Whistler provided the plant reference list in the Appendix 2.  Lelei Peau 
spearheaded the effort to translate the Guide into the Samoan language. 
 
Support to DMWR was provided by the Federal Aid in Sport Fish and Wildlife Restoration Acts.  
Printing was made possible by grants from the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit at the University of 
Hawaii, the National Park Service and the American Samoa Coral Reef Advisory Group.

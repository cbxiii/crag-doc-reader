bucket, chances are they will become confused and 
have little chances of surviving, let alone finding 
their home beach later (that is, if they don’t just die 
in the bucket). 
 
Sea turtles have been around for millions of years 
and survived just fine before humans started taking 
their babies off the beach, whether to “protect” 
them or otherwise.  Newly-hatched turtles, just like 
their gigantic moms and dads, are wild animals and 
are not meant to be kept as pets.  The ocean 
provides better food and a cleaner, healthier 
environment for turtles than humans can.  
 
Turtles are far-ranging animals that swim thousands and thousands of miles in the sea during their 
lifetimes.  When they go to their nesting islands, they meet with other turtles, mate, lay eggs, and so 
keep their species alive.  Every time a female sea turtle finds her way back to the beach where she was 
born and nests there, she completes the ancient, natural cycle that keeps sea turtles alive on Earth.  
Imagine a turtle imprisoned in a bucket, tub, or garbage can, swimming endlessly in tiny circles, never 
to see the open ocean, never to meet another turtle, never to help its species survive. 
 
Sea turtles all over the world are dwindling in number.  All species are listed as threatened or 
endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, including our own green and hawksbill sea turtles.  
If we want our children and grandchildren to be able to see these huge, magnificent sea turtles 
swimming alive and free in the ocean, where they belong, we have to do our best to protect them now.  
The very best way we can to do that is by protecting the beaches where they nest, letting the baby turtles 
find their own way into the sea, and not hunting the big turtles.  Future generations of turtles (and 
people) will thank us.

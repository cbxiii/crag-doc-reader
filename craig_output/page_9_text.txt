2.  Seasons and cyclones 
 
 
Samoa's weather may seem warm, wet and humid all year, but we do have two seasons.  Not exactly 
summer and winter, because Tutuila is a small dot in a vast tropical ocean, so the ocean moderates our 
weather year-round.  Our seasons are sometimes referred to as tropical wet and dry periods, although 
you may wonder, when is it ever dry here? 
 
October through May is our 8-month hot and wet 
summer.  Rainfall at the Tafuna airport weather 
station is about 11-14 inches per month and air 
temperature (averaged over a 24-hour period) is 
about 82-830 F (for the period 1990-2002).  Our 
cold spell occurs from June through September 
when averaged air temperatures plummet to 810 F 
and rainfall is reduced by half. 
 
Actual rainfall can vary much more than this, as 
we all know.  Minimum and maximum records 
for rainfall over a one-month period are 0.3 and 
32.7 inches.  The amount of rainfall we receive 
depends largely on where we are standing.  The 
harbor area is very wet -- it receives about 200 inches of rainfall per year.   Lata Mountain on Taâ€™u 
receives over 300 inches (25 feet) per year.  The Tafuna plains are much drier and receive a mere 125 
inches per year. 
 
If it seems like it rains every day here, it almost does.  In most years, the airport weather station detects 
at least a trace of rain 300 days of the year.  But a noticeable amount of rain (at least one tenth of an 
inch) occurs on about 50% of the days of the year.  But remember, the airport (where these 
measurements are taken) is the driest part of our island.  Relative humidity at the airport fluctuates in the 
80s (daily range 73-90%). 
 
Air temperatures in recent years typically fluctuate from nighttime lows around 770 F to afternoon highs 
in the upper 80s.  We now average 60 days per year at 900 or above.  Record highs and lows here are 960 
and 620 F.

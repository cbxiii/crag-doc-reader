This collection of articles provides a glimpse into the marine and wildlife resources in American 
Samoa's tropical, oceanic environment.  The articles were written biologists at the Department of 
Marine & Wildlife Resources (DMWR), National Park of American Samoa (NPS), Land Grant Program 
at the American Samoa Community College (ASCC), and University of Hawaii (UH).  Our purpose in 
writing was to make the results of our studies available to teachers, students, visitors and whoever else 
might be curious about Samoa's environment.  The use of English, Samoan and scientific names of 
plants and animals varies among chapters, so the reader is referred to cross-referenced lists in the 
species checklists and the plant index at the end of this report (Appendix 2).  
  
Several individuals, organizations and publishers kindly allowed their illustrations to be reprinted in this 
volume; their credits are listed in Appendix 2.  Special thanks to Dick Watling for permission to 
reproduce the excellent pictures from his books “Birds of Fiji, Tonga and Samoa” and “Birds of Fiji and 
Western Polynesia” (Pacificbirds.com).   
 
Joshua Seamon, Matt Le'i, Larry Basch and Tavita Togia provided comments throughout the text, and 
Tavita Togia and Art Whistler provided the plant reference list in the Appendix 2.  Lelei Peau 
spearheaded the effort to translate the Guide into the Samoan language. 
 
Support to DMWR was provided by the Federal Aid in Sport Fish and Wildlife Restoration Acts.  
Printing was made possible by grants from the Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit at the University of 
Hawaii, the National Park Service and the American Samoa Coral Reef Advisory Group.

1.  Local facts and maps 
 
 
Samoan Archipelago.  This chain of 13 Pacific islands (9 inhabited) plus two remote atolls is located 
140 south of the equator near the international date line.  It is divided into two political entities, 
the US Territory of American Samoa and the neighboring independent country of Samoa, 
formerly known as Western Samoa.  The youngest islands in this chain lie towards the east 
(Ta'u).  The land area of (western) Samoa (2934 km2, 1132 mi2) is approximately 15 times 
larger than the land area of American Samoa (197.1 km2, 76.1 mi2). 
 
Territory of American Samoa.  The total land area of 76.1 square miles (197.1 km2) includes five 
volcanic islands (Tutuila, Aunu'u, Ofu, Olosega, Ta'u) and two remote atolls (Rose, Swains). 
 
Population.  Polynesians arrived here about 3,000 years 
ago.  The current population (62,000 in 2005) is 
growing rapidly at about 1.8% per year, which 
equates to about 1,100 additional babies and 
immigrants per year.  Most people (96%) live on 
Tutuila Island.  The ethnic composition is 
approximately 90% Samoan, 4% Tongan,  2% 
Caucasian, and 4% others. 
 
Topography.  The main islands are steep mountains that 
emerge from the ocean floor 2-3 miles below the 
sea surface.  Peak elevations are 3,170 feet on 
Ta'u Island (Lata Mountain) and 2,142 feet on Tutuila Island (Matafao Peak). 
 
Climate.  Hot, humid and rainy year-round, but there is a long, wet summer season (October - May) and 
a slightly cooler and drier season (June - September).  Total rainfall is 125 inches at the Tafuna 
airport and 200+ inches in mountainous areas. 
 
Tropical cyclones (hurricanes).  While very destructive, cyclones are a 
natural but erratic feature of the environment in this part of the 
world.  The most recent ones in American Samoa have occurred at 
intervals of 1-13 years: 1981 Esau, 1987 Tusi, 1990 Ofa, 1991 
Val, 2004 Heta, 2005 Olaf. 
 
Native flora and fauna.  Most native species here are closely related to those in Indonesia, but due to 
our remote location in the Pacific Ocean, the diversity of terrestrial species here is low:  343 
flowering plants, 135 ferns, 25 resident or migratory land and water birds, 20 resident seabirds, 
3 mammals (all bats), 7 skinks, 4 geckos, 2 sea turtles, 1 snake, and other occasional visitors.  In 
contrast, the diversity of marine species here is high:  890 coral reef fishes, over 200 corals, and 
several whales and dolphins.  Insects and other invertebrate species here are not well known. 
 
Endemic species.  Species found only in the Samoan Archipelago include one bird (Samoan starling), 
one stream fish, several land snails, and about 30% of local plant species.  Five flowering plant 
species are endemic to American Samoa itself.  Marine endemics have not been 
identified, but a thorough investigation has not been conducted. 
 
Threatened or endangered species.  Federally listed species here include humpback and 
sperm whales, and the green and hawksbill sea turtles.  Additional species 'of

concern' in the Territory include the sheath-tailed bat, 3 birds (Spotless Crake, Friendly Ground 
Dove, Many-colored Fruit Dove), several land snails, and others. 
 
Pests and weeds (invasive non-native species).  There are many:  rats, 3 bird species (2 mynas and 
bulbuls), feral pigs, dogs, cats, toads, house gecko, tilapia and molly fishes, African and 
predatory snails, various insects, about 250 alien species of vascular plants (many of them weed 
species), and others. 
 
Dangerous species.  Few.  On land, no poisonous snakes, but a bite 
from a large 8-inch centipede can be extremely painful.  In the 
ocean, sharks are generally not a problem but stepping on the 
poisonous spine of a stonefish can be a serious medical 
emergency although this rarely happens.  Consumers of fish 
should note that ciguatera poisoning has been found (infrequently) in several snappers (locally 
called mu) and a few other fish species.  Also, avoid eating any fish or invertebrate caught in 
Pago Pago Harbor, because they are contaminated with heavy metals and other pollutants. 
 
Tropical diseases.  Malaria is not present, but two other mosquito-transmitted diseases can occur here:  
dengue fever (caused by a virus) and filariasis (elephantiasis, caused by a parasitic nematode 
worm).  However, the chance of getting either by a visitor is slight (see chapter on mosquitoes). 
Leptospirosis, a common tropical bacterial disease spread through contact with the urine of 
infected animals (pigs, dogs, cats, rats), is fairly common among local residents (17% recent 
infection history); most people have mild flu-like symptoms but it can be fatal.

2.  Seasons and cyclones 
 
 
Samoa's weather may seem warm, wet and humid all year, but we do have two seasons.  Not exactly 
summer and winter, because Tutuila is a small dot in a vast tropical ocean, so the ocean moderates our 
weather year-round.  Our seasons are sometimes referred to as tropical wet and dry periods, although 
you may wonder, when is it ever dry here? 
 
October through May is our 8-month hot and wet 
summer.  Rainfall at the Tafuna airport weather 
station is about 11-14 inches per month and air 
temperature (averaged over a 24-hour period) is 
about 82-830 F (for the period 1990-2002).  Our 
cold spell occurs from June through September 
when averaged air temperatures plummet to 810 F 
and rainfall is reduced by half. 
 
Actual rainfall can vary much more than this, as 
we all know.  Minimum and maximum records 
for rainfall over a one-month period are 0.3 and 
32.7 inches.  The amount of rainfall we receive 
depends largely on where we are standing.  The 
harbor area is very wet -- it receives about 200 inches of rainfall per year.   Lata Mountain on Ta’u 
receives over 300 inches (25 feet) per year.  The Tafuna plains are much drier and receive a mere 125 
inches per year. 
 
If it seems like it rains every day here, it almost does.  In most years, the airport weather station detects 
at least a trace of rain 300 days of the year.  But a noticeable amount of rain (at least one tenth of an 
inch) occurs on about 50% of the days of the year.  But remember, the airport (where these 
measurements are taken) is the driest part of our island.  Relative humidity at the airport fluctuates in the 
80s (daily range 73-90%). 
 
Air temperatures in recent years typically fluctuate from nighttime lows around 770 F to afternoon highs 
in the upper 80s.  We now average 60 days per year at 900 or above.  Record highs and lows here are 960 
and 620 F.

But if it feels like our climate it is getting warmer, it 
is, but the picture is a little complicated.  We have two 
long-term records of air temperature in American 
Samoa, the NOAA weather stations at the Tafuna 
airport and at Tula.  Temperature trends at these two 
sites are quite different, probably due to local 
conditions where the temperatures are actually 
measured.  Temperatures measured at the airport 
weather station have risen steadily over the past 20 
years (see graph), but no such increase has been 
recorded at the NOAA station in Tula.  The airport 
station measures air temperatures at a height of about 
5.5 feet above the ground, and it is located on the 
Tafuna Plains which is rapidly being built up with 
buildings and roads, so it is probably detecting a near-
ground increase in temperature that is felt by us.  
Whether other parts of Tutuila are warming in a 
similar fashion is not known.  In contrast, the Tula 
station is on the upwind side of the island and it measures air temperatures at 50 feet above the ground, 
so it is less affected by near-ground conditions.  It shows no increase in temperature, as would be 
expected at our remote oceanic location. 
 
As summer progresses, the temperature of the 
ocean’s surface waters also increases by about 30 F.  
Warmer ocean temperatures, in turn, help provide 
the energy to start tropical cyclones, thus the chance 
of a cyclone is greatest between November and 
April. 
 
Tropical cyclones have hit American Samoa at 
intervals of 1-13 years during the past 24 years: 
1981 Esau, 1987 Tusi, 1990 Ofa, 1991 Val, 2004 
Heta and 2005 Olaf.  Their severity varied -- Tusi was particularly damaging to Manu’a, the back-to-
back cyclones Ofa and Val hit Tutuila hard, Heta’s overall impact was moderate, Olaf slammed Manu’a 
hard. 
 
A world map of cyclone tracks (next page) 
helps put some perspective on American 
Samoa’s susceptibility to tropical cyclones.  
This map shows the tracks of all cyclones 
greater than 74 mph during the 10-year 
period 1994-2003.  It shows that cyclones 
are generated primarily in two bands that lie 
north and south of the earth’s equator at 
latitudes of about 10-300.  American Samoa 
lies near the edge of the cyclone band in the 
southern hemisphere where cyclone activity 
begins to fade.

It is curious that there are no cyclones along the equator or around South America.  This occurs because 
cyclones require two general conditions to develop:  (1) warm ocean waters at least 800 F (26.50 C) to 
fuel the cyclone, and (2) enough Coriolis force (caused by the earth’s rotation) to provide stability and 
spin to a developing storm.  Coriolis force is weakest along the equator, so developing storms there 
remain unstable and do not develop into cyclones.  South America has few cyclones due to cool water 
temperatures (upwelling along the west coast) or other climatic conditions (on the east coast) that are 
not conducive for cyclone development. 
 
 
Tracks of tropical cyclones during the 10-year period 1994-2003. 
 
Cyclones are a regular but erratic feature of the environment in our part of the world, so it is likely that 
native species inhabiting American Samoa are able to cope with cyclone impacts and recover, given 
enough time and assuming that their recovery is not jeopardized by human-related conditions such as 
habitat loss due to human population increases, competition by invasive alien species, pollution, or 
changing environmental conditions due to global climate change. 
 
Returning to the topic of seasons, some plants and animals in Samoa schedule their activities, such as 
flowering or spawning, according to the seasons.  These biological events tend to occur over a much 
longer period in the tropics compared to colder regions of the world, because the distinction between 
our two seasons is not great and growing conditions here are generally good year-round.  Nevertheless, 
seasonal patterns of flowering and fruiting mean times of abundance or scarcity for some of our native 
wildlife, particularly the fruit bats (pe'a) and Pacific pigeon (lupe). 
 
Some animals schedule their seasonal migrations to our islands to avoid winters elsewhere in the world.  
We see more golden plovers (tuli) and tourists during the October to March period when they flee 
winter in the northern hemisphere, while humpback whales (tofola) visit us in August-October when 
they escape winter in the southern hemisphere.

3.  Biodiversity in our rainforests and coral reefs 
 
 
There's a certain mystique about the word 'biodiversity' that seems to be associated with images of 
steamy jungles or wondrous new medicines, but the word more specifically refers to the number of 
species or 'species richness' of an area.  One reason why tropical areas are so fascinating is that they 
contain the highest numbers of plant and animal species found anywhere on earth. 
 
American Samoa sits squarely in the tropics, so we should have a high biological diversity here, but we 
do and we don't.  There is a sharp contrast between the number of plant and animal species that live on 
land here (few) versus those that live in our coastal waters (many).  Most small islands in the South 
Pacific share this characteristic. 
 
To start at the beginning, when our islands emerged as fiery volcanoes from the depths of the sea, they 
were devoid of plants or animals.  As time passed and the terrain became more hospitable, life for 
organisms became possible, but the plants and animals still had to cross vast ocean distances to get here 
from someplace else. 
A quick look at a map will show one reason why few land 
species got here.  We are really quite isolated in the Pacific 
Ocean, far from potential sources of plants and animals.  To 
reach our shores, organisms would either have to blow in on 
the wind, drift for hundreds or thousands of miles on some 
piece of floating debris, or be carried in by another organism 
like plant seeds in a bird's stomach.  The species that were 
successful probably got here by 'island hopping' across the 
Pacific, spreading from island to island over the course of 
many thousands or millions of years. 
 
The difficulty in getting here is best illustrated by the sparse 
representation of native mammal species.  Over the past 1.3 
million years that Tutuila Island has existed, only 3 mammal 
species (all bats) got here and established viable populations.  
Our native species list also includes about 478 flowering plants and ferns, 25 resident land and water 
birds, 20 resident seabirds, 7 skinks, 4 geckos, 2 sea turtles, 1 snake, and occasional other visitors (this 
list does not include all the introduced non-native species like rats, dogs, pigs, toads, myna birds, and 
many weeds). 
  
There's a second reason for our low diversity on land -- the small size of our islands.  In general, the 
smaller the island, the fewer the species on it.  For example, tiny Rose Atoll (0.4 sq mi) supports only 5 
native plant species, 21 birds (virtually all seabirds), 2 geckos, and 2 sea turtles. 
 
So, although American Samoa technically has 'tropical rainforests' due to our high level of rainfall (200-
300 inches per year in some mountainous areas), we lack the high species richness found in the jungle 
rainforests of Indonesia, Africa or South America that are filled with hooting monkeys, poison dart 
frogs, pythons and flesh-eating piranhas. 
 
On the other hand, because of our isolation, some terrestrial species in Samoa have evolved over many 
thousands of years to such an extent that they have become distinctly different species found nowhere 
else but here.  For example, 1% of our plant species occur only in American Samoa; 30% of our plant 
species and the Samoan starling (fuia) occur only in the Samoan archipelago (which includes western

11
Samoa); and the Samoan fruit bat occurs only in the Samoan and Fijian islands.  So, our rainforest may 
lack diversity, but it contains some species found nowhere else on earth. 
 
Turning to our marine environment, we find the opposite situation.  There is an incredibly diverse 
ecosystem just beneath the waves.  Coral reefs are among the most species-rich ecosystems in the world.  
We have, for example, 890 nearshore fish species which is an amazingly high number compared to 
many other coastal areas.  To get a sense of this species-rich environment, if you were to dive on our 
reefs once a week, you could in theory see a new fish species on every dive for 17 years. 
 
Although coral reefs are limited to shallow waters, usually around the fringes of islands, most coral reef 
species have eggs and larvae that can survive for weeks or months in the open ocean and get dispersed 
by ocean currents to new locations.  As a result of this genetic exchange of marine organisms between 
islands, there are probably few marine species that are unique to the Samoan islands. 
 
Finally, superimposed over the South Pacific region is a larger-scale pattern of species distributions. 
Most of our marine and land species can be traced back to the same or related species inhabiting 
mainland and insular southeast Asia.  From that center of remarkably high diversity, rainforest and coral 
reef species radiated out, spreading eastward across the South Pacific islands.  But like ripples in a pond, 
the farther away one gets from that 'center', the fewer the species (see map below).  This same pattern 
applies to corals, fishes, sea turtles, seagrasses, mangroves, land birds and plants.  Very few species 
reached here from the opposite direction (South America) probably due to the much greater distance and 
fewer islands in that direction to facilitate 'island hopping'.

4. This volcano we live on 
 
 
The geology of the Samoan islands is surprisingly interesting.  First, we are living on a volcano, which 
is resting quietly at the moment.  Second, our volcano is on the move -- it's traveling towards China with 
us on it.  And, finally and most unfortunately, our volcano is doomed and it will eventually sink back 
into the dark ocean depths. 
 
About 1.3 million years ago, our volcano spewed forth enough lava to rise up out of the ocean and 
become “Tutuila Island”.  Actually, just the tip of the volcano is visible to us -- most of the mountain is 
underwater.  While the tallest mountain peak on Tutuila is about one half mile high, the mountain 
extends another 2 miles below the sea surface. 
 
It is not really an exaggeration to call the Samoan islands 'active volcanoes'.  These islands were indeed 
formed by volcanism, and the volcanoes are still active, in a geologic timeframe of course, and due to 
some unusual circumstances as described below. 
 
The most recent volcanic eruptions were a lot more recent than many people realize.  In western Samoa, 
major eruptions occurred in 1905 when lava flows destroyed a village.  In the Manu'a islands, 
subsurface volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurred in 1866, causing dense clouds of smoke and 
pumice to erupt from the ocean surface for several months.  One hundred years ago is just a blink of the 
eye to a volcano, which measures time in the millions of years.  We humans tend to forget how briefly 
people have lived upon these shores. Human habitation on Tutuila, even considering the whole 3000-
year period that Samoans have dwelt here, represents a mere 0.2% of the time since the sun first shone 
on this new land. 
 
To explain our volcano's slow-motion march towards China, we first need to review the nature of the 
earth's surface or crust.  The earth's outer layer, the one we live on, is several miles thick, but that is a 
thin skin compared to the total size of the earth.  This outer layer is made up of many separate sections 
that seemingly float on top of the earth's molten core and move about in very slow motion.  Geologists 
call these outer sections “plates”.  You may recall, for example, that the continents of Africa and South 
America were once joined together when the earth first formed, but the two continents slowly drifted 
apart to where they are today.  The same process applies to the plates under the Pacific Ocean.  The 
plate we're on is called the Pacific Plate and it is moving westward (towards China) at a leisurely speed 
of about 3 inches per year.  At this rate, in one million years we will be 50 miles closer to China. 
 
It is not accidental that the islands of American Samoa and 
western Samoa lie roughly in a straight line.  Directly 
underneath us is what geologists call a “hot spot” of thermal 
activity in the earth's core.  It's a volcano just waiting to 
happen.  When the pressure builds up at the hot spot, molten 
magma bursts up through the Pacific Plate and forms a 
volcanic island.  Then the hot spot calms down for awhile, 
perhaps a million years or so.  During this peaceful interval, 
the Pacific Plate keeps marching onward, so when the hot 
spot acts up again, it forms a new volcanic island rather than 
build upon the previous one.  In other words, the hot spot 
stays in one place but the plate above it keeps moving. 
 
The islands formed generally lie in a straight line that is oriented in the direction the plate is moving.  
The new islands form on the eastern end of the chain, so the islands become progressively older as you

move from east to west.  For that reason, the islands in 
western Samoa are about 1 million years older than the 
islands in American Samoa.  (Early geologists got this 
direction of movement backwards.)   The newest 
volcanic eruption in our island chain is forming about 
30 miles east of Ta'u Island, but it will probably be 
another few hundred years before this sub-surface 
volcano, named Vailulu'u, breaks the sea surface (in 
2005 it was 1800 feet below the surface but growing 
rapidly). 
 
But something else really exciting also happens in our area.  
As Tutuila Island glides westward, a part of our plate collides 
with another plate to the west of us (the Australian Plate), and 
our plate actually rips in two at this point (see diagram).  One 
piece of our plate continues moving towards China, but the 
other piece slides down into the 6-mile deep Tongan Trench 
and under the Australian Plate, never to be seen again. 
 
The collision of these two colossal pieces of the earth's surface 
causes the seafloor to bend and rip, which in turn causes some 
earthquakes.  This is shown on the map at right which 
pinpoints all earthquakes (magnitude 6.0 or greater) in the 
Pacific region in 2004.  Samoa and the Tongan 
Trench are a geologically active area and this is 
presumably the cause of renewed volcanic activity in 
our archipelago.  Recent surveys suggest how this 
might be happening.  Long cracks  in the seafloor 
have been discovered between the Samoan islands 
and the Tongan Trench.  The cracks are oriented in 
an east-west direction and seem to be formed as the 
seafloor bends southward down into the top of the 
Tongan Trench.  These cracks may make it easier for 
the hot magma beneath the crust to spew upward and 
emerge as young lava on top of our old islands.   
 
And all this is happening a mere 100 miles south of 
Tutuila Island.  We live in a very unique area. 
 
Finally, most oceanic volcanoes eventually disappear.  As time passes, two things happen.  Volcanoes 
erode continuously as ocean waves attack its shorelines and rivers gouge into its terrain.  In addition, the 
weight of a newly formed volcano is so heavy that it causes the volcano to sink slowly back down into 
the sea.  Rose Atoll and Swains Island are good examples of sunken volcanoes.  In the distant past, Rose 
and Swains may have been magnificent mountainous islands with beautiful rainforests and coral reefs.  
But that's ancient history now, because those islands, over a period of several million years, eventually 
sank out of sight.  All that remains are tiny amounts of coral that grew up from the peaks of the 
mountains as they slipped below the sea surface. 
 
Not to worry.  Tutuila Island should be around for a few more million years.

6.  Our deep blue ocean 
 
 
American Samoa is much larger than you might think it is.  The whole Territory covers 117,500 square 
miles, which is about the size of New Zealand or the state of Oregon.  The Territory is big because we 
claim jurisdiction of the ocean that surrounds American Samoa, from the shoreline out to 200 miles 
offshore.  That is standard procedure throughout the world (each country with marine coasts wants to 
protect its coastline and marine resources from others).  To be more precise, American Samoa has 
jurisdiction over territorial waters out to 3 miles, while the US federal government maintains control of 
the zone from 3 to 200 miles from shore. 
 
Most of the Territory is open 
ocean, of course.  Only a 
minuscule 0.1% of the area 
consists of dry land (all 7 islands 
total only 76.1 square miles).  The 
other 99.9% marine portion 
consists of two main habitats -- the 
shallow coastal waters adjacent to 
the islands (a'au, aloalo) and the 
deep waters offshore (vasa).  
Shallow coastal habitats, with their 
coral reefs and colorful fish, are quite limited in total area because our islands slope steeply down into 
deeper water and depths of 2000 feet are reached within 0.5-2 miles from shore.  So, most of our coral 
reefs are restricted to a narrow ring around each island.  There is also some coral on the tops of several 
offshore seamounts in the Territory. 
 
The rest of our marine environment consists of deep blue ocean with a fairly flat seafloor 2-3 miles 
below the sea surface.  The reason for the blue color of the ocean is an interesting one and it is a key 
factor to understanding our ocean ecosystem, so we need to get technical for a moment.  Water by itself 
is highly transparent with a bluish tinge.  What adds other colors to the ocean are, in large part, small 
marine plant-like cells called phytoplankton.  The more phytoplankton in the water, the greener the 
water becomes.  Phytoplankton require two main ingredients to grow well:  sunlight and nutrients 
(fertilizers).  If they have both, they grow in abundance.  This, in turn, supports a productive food web:  
phytoplankton provide food for the microscopic shrimp-like animals (zooplankton), and the zooplankton 
provide food for the fish to eat. 
 
Tropical oceans are not green because conditions are generally not good for phytoplankton growth.  
Although phytoplankton have all the sunlight they could ever want in the surface layer, nutrient levels 
there are too low to support much plant growth.  This occurs because the deep tropical ocean is typically 
stratified into two layers with very different temperatures.  The sun heats up the surface layer, which is 
about 300 feet deep, to a pleasant 840 F, but the deeper layer remains a chilly 420 F.  Because warm 
water is lighter than cold water, the warm ocean water generally stays on top, the cold water stays on the 
bottom.  The two layers do not mix. 
 
That's the rub.  The bottom layer is where the nutrients are, but because of the 2-layer stratification, the 
nutrients can't get up to the surface layer where they are needed to combine with sunlight for plant 
growth.  So, conditions for phytoplankton are not very good in the tropical ocean.  The surface layer has 
lots of light but few nutrients, while the bottom layer has lots of nutrients but no light.  It's pitch black 
down there.  This arrangement doesn't support a very productive foodweb, so there are generally fewer 
fish in tropical oceans than in non-tropical oceans.

You might wonder, how is it that non-tropical oceans are much more productive?  The answer is, again, 
temperature.  Away from the tropics, seasonal changes in water temperature cause the water to mix.  
Winter temperatures cool the upper layer causing it to sink and mix with the bottom layer, and when this 
occurs, some nutrients are brought up to the surface.  The nutrients in shallow sunlit waters stimulate 
phytoplankton growth, thus fueling a more productive foodweb. 
 
In the tropics, the 2-layer stratification of the ocean persists year-round because hot sun keeps the 
surface layer warm.  The tropical ocean has been called a 'biological desert' for this reason.  That's an 
exaggeration, of course, because all the tuna out there are finding something to eat.  And, many other 
species live out there as well, from an occasional whale, dolphin, sea turtle or seabird, to numerous 
species of fish and invertebrates such as jellyfish and shrimp-like crustaceans. 
 
 
 
              Marlin (sa'ula) 
       Mahimahi (masimasi) 
               Tuna (atu) 
 
What are some of the marine resources in our offshore waters?  Three ocean resources of potential 
interest to American Samoa are fish, minerals and the water itself.  Several kinds of food and sport fish 
are present in modest numbers: tuna, masimasi, marlin, wahoo, sharks, and flying fish.  Surveys 
indicate, however, that the abundance of oceanic fishes within our 200-mile limit is probably not high 
enough to warrant significant commercial development of offshore fisheries.  That's the main reason 
why the big tuna boats that deliver to American Samoa's 
canneries travel far beyond our 200-mile zone to other 
locations where the tuna are more abundant (the canneries are 
located here only to gain duty-free access to US markets).   
 
Another resource mentioned from time to time are mineral 
deposits, such as manganese nodules, that lie on the seafloor.  
However, these nodules, even if present in our waters, are too 
deep for economic extraction by current technologies. 
 
Perhaps a more exploitable resource in the future involves the 
temperature of the ocean's cold bottom layer.  Scientists are 
working on a technology that extracts energy (to produce 
electricity) through a heat-exchange mechanism that is made 
possible by the large temperature difference between the 
tropical ocean's warm surface and cold bottom layers.  A 
demonstration facility for this technology has been operating 
in Hawaii since the 1970's, but it has been an uneconomical 
venture so far.  The two requirements for this technology -- a 
large temperature differential in the ocean, and easy access to 
this temperature difference by land-based facilities -- are met 
in American Samoa.  Will our future electricity needs be 
powered by our own blue ocean?

7.  What is coral?   
 
 
The islands of American Samoa are blessed with 
an abundance of coral (about 200 species), so 
this article presents an introduction to these 
unusual organisms. 
 
Corals are animals like ourselves, although that 
may not be readily apparent because many look 
like whitish rocks, especially those washed up on 
the beach.  In a sense, corals are indeed partly 
rock, because only the outer thin layer of the 
coral is inhabited by the coral animal itself.  In 
that way, corals are like large trees – the inner 
part is hard and provides structural support, the 
outer part is the living, growing organism.  And, 
like trees, most coral animals are permanently 
attached to one spot on the reef. 
                                                                                              
The coral rubble that Samoans traditionally spread outside their houses, and the coral rocks along our 
beaches, are old, dead pieces that broke off the reef during a storm, got tumbled around and tossed up on 
the beach. 
 
Living corals grow primarily on the outer reef flat and in deeper water.  Although they take varied 
shapes, the coral animals inhabiting their surfaces are similar.  They look somewhat like miniature sea 
anemones (matamalu, ulumane) or upside-down jellyfish (alualu) with short tentacles that give the coral 
a slightly fuzzy appearance when the tentacles are extended.  Each single coral animal is called a polyp, 
but the coral branch or block we see on the reef is actually not a single animal but a colony of hundreds 
or thousands of tiny polyps living side by side, giving the appearance of being a single “coral”.  The 
coral's short tentacles can be pulled back into the hard part of the coral when the animal is disturbed  
or when the coral is exposed at low tide, so even a live coral can look like a rock at such times. 
 
 
 
 
In the coral shown at left, a single polyp lives in each hole, but all the polyps have withdrawn  
into their skeleton (the polyps of many coral species emerge only at night).  In the coral at right,  
many fuzzy-looking polyps have emerged to feed.  
 
It seems inconceivable that these tiny coral polyps can build the hard coral ‘rocks’ that we see on the 
reef.  They do this by secreting layers of a hard substance (calcium carbonate) beneath their living cells.

Diagram of a coral polyp 
 
 
It’s as if each tiny polyp built a rock-solid house for itself but then, as it grows bigger, it decides to close-
off the bottom rooms in its house.  Then it grows some more and closes-off another layer of bottom 
rooms, and so on.  In this way, the coral polyp always lives in the outer, top layer which has been built 
upon layers and layers of rooms below.  Each polyp also cements its house to those of its adjacent 
neighbors which strengthens the whole structure, resembling a solidly built high-rise apartment complex.   
 
Adding on these new rooms is a slow process.  Growth varies from about 0.5-3 inches per year 
depending on the species.  The photo on the right shows this nicely (it was part of a science project).  
When this particular coral was living on the reef, it was stained with a harmless red die that was 
absorbed only by the outside layer of living 
tissue.  Then, as the coral grew, it added the red 
stain to the new skeleton it was making, thus 
marking the size of the coral at the time it was 
stained.  After the stain was used up, the newly 
laid skeleton was again white.  After a one-year 
period, the coral was sawed in half and we can 
clearly see the pink band inside the coral.  The 
distance from the pink band to the new outer edge 
of the coral is the amount that this coral grew in 
one year (about 0.3 inches in this case, as 
measured on the actual sample). 
 
Over very long time periods, these corals grow into massively strong reef structures that can bear the 
brunt of powerful waves that crash upon them day after day.  The very largest corals on our reefs may 
be hundreds of years old.  Corals are one of the few organisms on earth that continually build on top of 
their old ‘houses’, forming such large solid structures.  This is not like a bird that might build its nest on 
top of another nest, because both of these nests decay and disappear in a short time.  In fact, most 
organisms on earth leave little trace after they die as their bones or shells disintegrate (dust to dust).  Not 
corals.  They build structures much larger and longer-lasting than the Egyptian pyramids.  What other 
organism can do this (except modern man with his steel and cement)? 
 
Consider Swains Island or Rose Atoll, for example.  Both are the remnants of old volcanoes that, after 
millions of years, finally sank back down beneath the ocean’s surface and disappeared altogether as 
volcanic islands usually do (see Chapter 4).  But as they slowly sank, the coral continued to grow on top 
of the submerged mountain tops, layer by layer, keeping pace with the sinking rate of the mountain.  
The thickness of the coral there now is probably hundreds or thousands of feet thick on top of the old 
mountain peak and it's all that’s left poking above the ocean surface.  Were it not for this thick coral 
formation on top of these old mountains, Swains Island and Rose Atoll would not exist today.

8.  When corals turn white and die 
 
 
Coral reefs in American Samoa have turned pure white on several occasions in recent years.  They look 
freshly bleached, quite pretty, but that's a clear sign that they are in trouble. 
 
Two very different kinds of stress cause corals to turn 
white: (1) clorox bleach, and (2) warm water 
temperatures.  Clorox bleaching happens from time to 
time when a foolish fisherman dumps clorox onto the reef 
to kill fish.  This is very short-sighted because it also kills 
everything else in the vicinity -- young fish, crabs, snails 
and corals -- and that harms the reef itself and reduces 
everyone else's catch. 
 
Unusually warm water temperatures, due either to weather 
events or global warming, can also cause the coral to 
bleach.  It only takes a slight increase above normal water 
temperature to bleach the coral.  Bleaching can be caused 
by a short-term exposure (1-2 days) at temperature 
elevations of 3-4 degrees, or by long-term exposure 
(weeks) at elevations of only 1-2 degrees.  To a diver, this 
may look like a pretty snowfall on the reef, but it indicates 
that the reef is seriously stressed. 
 
Because most corals live only in warm tropical waters, it 
seems odd that corals will die when the water gets slightly 
warmer.  They live close to the hottest temperature that 
they can tolerate, so it doesn't take much to push them 
over the limit.  To explain what is happening, recall that 
corals are animals with colorful plant-like cells 
(zooxanthellae) living in their tissues.  These cells use the sun's light to produce food which is also used 
by the coral animal.  Many coral animals receive much of their food this way, so this relationship is 
quite important to the coral animal.  The animal, in turn, provides the zooxanthellae with nutrients and a 
secure place to live.  Both the coral and the zooxanthellae benefit from this arrangement. 
 
When the coral is stressed by warmer than usual 
temperatures, the zooxanthellae are released from the 
coral, for reasons known only to them.  What's left is a 
rather colorless coral animal overlying a bright white coral 
skeleton (see drawing).  The animal portion of the coral 
may eventually recover its zooxanthellae and continue 
living, or it may die, depending on how stressed it gets.  
It's easy to tell when portions of the coral die because they 
become covered with fuzzy green algae. 
 
A little bleaching now occurs here during most summers, 
but it was particularly bad in 1994, 2002 and 2003.  Not 
all coral species were affected then, but those in shallow 
waters were hardest hit, although some bleaching down to 
the 130-foot depth was observed.  Bleaching also occurred 
 
Normal coral polyp        Heat-stress causes the 
with plant-like cells        coral polyp to release 
inside the coral's           its plant-like cells and 
tissues.                          turn white like the 
                                      photo to the right.

in 1998 when we experienced very low tides due to a strong El Nino event.  The exposed corals turned 
white and died. 
 
As if that weren’t enough, we are also 
seeing more coral diseases on our reefs 
(who would have thought that corals can 
catch diseases?).  Presumably the heat-
stressed condition of the corals makes 
them more vulnerable to diseases that 
had formerly been rare.  In the photo at 
right, a white band of death is sweeping 
across the coral, from left to right.  
Behind the white band (to the left), the 
coral polyps were killed about a week or 
two ago, giving time for greenish algae 
to start growing on the dead coral 
skeleton.  The white band itself is a zone 
of freshly killed polyps and exposed 
white coral skeleton.  In front of the 
white band (to the right) is the last 
remaining bit of live coral (purplish in color).  The cause of this disease is not known yet.  Although 
coral diseases have probably always been around, they spread rapidly on our reefs beginning in 2002.   
 
To round-out this rather negative view of the problems coral face in our modern world, an even greater 
threat to them is a projected change in water chemistry in the ocean due to global warming.  Just as 
carbon dioxide (the main greenhouse gas causing global warming) is increasing in the air, it also 
increases in seawater in its dissolved form.  That will lower the pH of seawater which, in turn, may slow 
the rate at which corals build their calcium carbonate skeletons.  The result is that coral growth would 
be slowed and there might even be an increased erosion of the reef itself.  
 
Scientists predict that episodes of warm water temperatures will become more frequent due to a general 
warming of the earth.  That's bad news for us.  While it's unlikely that all of our corals will die off as the 
environment gets warmer, the number and/or abundance of corals may well decline here.  That might 
impact American Samoa in two general ways.  First, coral growth might not keep up with rising sea 
levels or the reef itself may begin to erode, thereby allowing more storm waves to reach our shorelines 
and cause damage to roads and houses.  Second, a reduction in coral growth and number of species 
could reduce the diversity of habitats required by fish, so a downturn in reef catches could eventually 
occur.  Both of these changes would probably occur at a slow but steady pace over the next 30 years. 
 
What to do?  Not too much, unfortunately, because American 
Samoa has little impact on the world's changing climate.  On the 
other hand, it makes sense not to worsen the situation by further 
stressing our coral reefs with rubbish, sewage from piggeries, or 
dirt (sediment) from land-use activities that flows into streams 
and out onto the reefs.  The brown water we see entering the 
ocean from streams after a heavy rainfall is harmful to the 
corals.  Additionally, we should locate and protect any areas 
where corals appear to be naturally resilient to bleaching events.  
These hardy survivors could then help re-seed other areas where 
the corals had died.

9.  Palolo swarming 
 
 
Once or twice a year, palolo swarm to the surface of the sea in great numbers.  Samoans eagerly await 
this night and scoop up large amounts of this delicacy along the shoreline with hand nets.  This gift from 
the sea was traditionally greeted with necklaces made from the fragrant moso’oi flower and the night of 
the palolo was and still remains a happy time of celebration.  The rich taste of palolo is enjoyed raw or 
fried with butter, onions or eggs, or spread on toast. 
 
Palolo is the edible portion of a polychaete worm (Eunice viridis)    
that lives in shallow coral reefs throughout the south central  
Pacific, although they do not swarm at all of these locations.  This 
phenomenon is well known in Samoa, Rarotonga, Tonga, Fiji, the 
Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. 
 
Palolo are about 12 inches long and live in burrows dug into the coral 
pavement on the outer reef flat.  They are composed of two distinct 
sections (see drawing).  The front section is the basic segmented 
polychaete with eyes, mouth, etc., followed by a string of segments 
called the “epitoke” that contain reproductive gametes colored blue-
green (females) or tan (males).  Each epitoke segments bear a tiny 
eyespot that can sense light (that's why islanders are able to use a 
lantern to attract the palolo to their nets). 
  
When it comes time to spawn, palolo will back out of their burrows and release the epitoke section from 
their body.  The epitokes then twirl around in the water in vast numbers and look like dancing spaghetti.  
Around daybreak, the segments dissolve and release the 
eggs and sperm that they contain. The fertilized eggs 
hatch into small larvae that drift with the plankton until 
settling on a coral reef to begin life anew. 
 
The swarming of palolo is a classic example of the 
coordinated mass spawning of a simple marine organism.  
The worms emerge from their burrows during a specific 
phase of the moon, but the actual date is a bit complicated.  
The swarms occur on the evenings of the last quarter 
moon of spring or early summer.  In Samoa, this is seven 
days after the full moon in October or November.  
Swarming occurs for two or three consecutive nights with 
the second night usually having the strongest showing. 
 
Palolo usually appear here in October, but sometimes in 
November or sometimes during both months.  This difference is due to the fact that there are 
approximately thirteen lunar months in one calendar year and the palolo use primarily the moon to time 
their spawning activity.  If instead they always spawned every twelve lunar months, their time of 
spawning would occur earlier every year.  After a few years, they would be spawning in August or July.  
In order to make up for this difference, the palolo will delay spawning in some years to the thirteen lunar 
month. 
 
The fact that palolo adjust their spawning time means that there are other factors beside the moon that 
determine the time of year they begin to mature and are ready to release their epitokes.  Several studies 
Palolo underwater.

on this matter have suggested that rising seawater temperatures, tides, weather, moonlight or other 
biological signals may play a role in starting the maturation and release of the epitokes.  Once the 
swarming begins, the presence of the palolo spawn in the water probably stimulates other palolo to 
release their mature epitokes. 
 
Rules For Predicting Emergence.  Everyone seems to have their own methods for predicting when the 
best palolo rising will occur.  Several natural clues that preceded the palolo rising enabled islanders to 
predict the correct timing for palolo swarming.  These included the flowering of the moso’oi tree, the 
closing of the palulu flower (a morning glory), a strong smell from the reef, brown foamy scum (from 
coral spawn) on the ocean, toxins occurring in reef fish, and abrupt weather changes or bad weather 
such as thunderstorms or lightning.   
 
So, will palolo swarm seven days after the full moon in October or November?  One set of rules used to 
predict the main night of emergence depends on the calendar date of October's third quarter moon 
(seven days after October's full moon).  If it occurs: 
 
1.  From October 1 to 8, palolo will not appear  
     until November. 
 
2.  From October 8 to 18, palolo will not appear in 
     October or the swarming will be weak followed  
     by a stronger appearance in November. 
 
3.  From October 19 to November 7, there will be  
     a single, strong swarming centered on this date. 
 
4.  From November 8 to 17, there will be a strong 
     appearance on this date, possibly following a 
     weaker swarming during the previous month  
     (see number 2 above). 
 
To further complicate matters, the actual time of emergence of 
palolo in Samoa differs between islands.  They usually appear 
around 2 am in the Manu’a Islands, 1 am on Tutuila and closer to 4 
or 5 am in western Samoa.  This difference is somewhat consistent 
from year to year and cannot be accounted for by difference in 
tides or moonrise.  The difference in tides between islands is far 
less than one hour and the time of moonrise is only minutes apart.

10.  Giant clams (faisua) 
 
 
It's always a pleasure to see one of these beauties on the reef.  Giant clams (faisua) are large, colorful 
and, surprisingly, they are part animal and part “plant”.  That's because giant clams, like corals, have 
plant-like cells (zooxanthellae) in their tissues that produce free food for the clams.  When a clam opens 
its shell and spreads out its pretty mantle, it exposes these solar panels of zooxanthellae to the sun to 
make food, like a plant unfolding its leaves. 
At the same time, the clam also gets some food by 
drawing water through its siphon and filtering out any 
tiny food particles (zooplankton).  Perhaps that's why 
giant clams grow so large – they have two very different 
ways to get food. 
 
We have two native species of giant clams in our local 
waters, Tridacna maxima and T. squamosa, which look 
fairly similar.  They grow to about 12-15 inches in shell 
length, although most found today are smaller because the 
larger ones have been over-harvested.  The largest and 
most famous species of giant clam (T. gigas), which 
grows as big as a large suitcase, is not native here but has 
been recently imported.  Over the past 15 years, 
mariculture efforts by DMWR have introduced T. gigas and T. derasa, and re-introduced Hippopus 
hippopus, a shallow-water species that was formerly present. 
 
Because giant clams need sunlight, they inhabit shallow, clear waters down to about 60 feet deep.  They 
grow very slowly; one local clam was 18 years old.  They spawn repeatedly over their life span and 
release millions of eggs each time they spawn, but most young clams do not survive, so the adults have 
to live a long time and spawn many times to insure that the population survives.  Larval clams swim in 
the water for about a week, then settle permanently onto the reef to grow. 
 
The clams are a favorite food item throughout the South Pacific and their accessibility in shallow waters 
and slow growth make them susceptible to overfishing.  That is very much the case in American Samoa, 
where few remain on many of our reefs near populated areas.  There is a growing concern that our 
population of giant clams may be getting too few and far between to spawn successfully.   
 
Partly for that reason, there has been an interest in growing these clams in hatcheries to supply markets 
for food and the aquarium trade.  DMWR has operated a hatchery here for many years and tried to 
encourage local production by supplying small clams for local 'farmers' to grow them on their reefs.  
That effort has met with limited success for several reasons.  Considerable dedication is needed because 
it may take several years to grow the clams to a commercial size, and the clams have to be protected 
from poachers and predators.  And there are always fa'alavelave events that call for contributions of 
giant clams if anyone has some.  In general, giant clam mariculture here has usually supplemented 
family needs rather than create a commercial business.  Periodically, the idea of raising the clams to a 
small size for the aquarium trade is talked about as a possible market. 
 
Harvest regulations in American Samoa (in 2005) are:  giant clams taken for 
personal consumption must be at least 6 inches in shell length, or if sold, a 
license is required and giant clams must be at least 7 inches in shell length and 
sold with the clam still in its shell.

11.  Master of disguise:  the octopus (fe’e) 
 
 
Locked in eye contact, we each wondered what the other was going to 
do.  The octopus tried to become invisible by changing its color, but I 
could still see his eyes, and he knew it.  Then a small distracting cloud 
of inky smoke appeared in his direction and he was gone. 
 
There’s no other reef animal quite like the octopus (fe’e).  Although it 
looks like a large, unprotected meal for some big fish, it is hardly 
defenseless.  The octopus is the “masters of disguise” for its superb ability to become invisible by 
changing the color and texture of its skin to match its surroundings.  With its good eyesight and well-
developed brain, it is probably the most intelligent of all invertebrates.  And if camouflage and quick 
wits don’t suffice, it can either squeeze down very small holes or escape by jet propulsion, leaving its 
calling card, an inky cloud that acts as a decoy or smoke screen to momentarily confuse a predator while 
the octopus vanishes. 
 
The octopus commonly seen locally is the reef octopus, Octopus cyanea, which is mottled red-brown in 
color with a large spot beneath each eye.  It typically weighs 2-3 lbs.  It is a mollusk, related to squid, 
snails, clams, but the octopus lacks a shell and has eight strong arms covered with suckers.  It breathes 
by sucking water into its mantle cavity and over its gills; it then expels the water through its funnel.  If 
threatened by a predator, it can expel this water forcefully, causing it to jet away. 
 
Fe’e feed on crustaceans (crabs, shrimps, lobsters) and mollusks (cowry snails) by creeping up on them.  
After pouncing on an unsuspecting prey, the octopus holds it tightly with its suckers until it can bite the 
animal with its parrot-like beak and inject a toxin to paralyze the prey.  It may take its meal back to the 
safety of its den (the reef hole it calls home), and that’s why there are often telltale bits of shells around 
an octopus den.  Mating occurs year-round.  The female lays her eggs inside her den and cares for them 
until they hatch.  She then dies.  When the eggs hatch, out pop miniature octopuses that are dispersed by 
water currents until they settle back onto the reef. 
 
The octopus is a favorite food of local fishermen who often check particular holes on the reef known to 
be good den sites for fe’e.  Octopus are taken by hand or spear and they account for about 5-10% of all 
the fish and invertebrates harvested on our reefs.  The drooping, pale gray octopus we see hung out for 
sale along the roadside is a ghoulish remnant of this crafty 
animal. 
 
The octopus is also caught by a traditional lure made of a 
large cowry shell that resembles a rat (isumu).  That came 
about due to an event that happened long ago, as related in 
the Samoan legend about the octopus and the rat.  It all 
started with a sightseeing canoe trip on the ocean by an 
owl, a snail and a rat.  Their canoe started to sink, so the owl escaped by flying away, the snail sank with 
the canoe to the bottom of the ocean (goto uga), and the rat tried to swim to shore but he had a long way 
to go.  He saw an octopus and called for help.  The octopus agreed and swam to shore with the rat on his 
head.  When they got to shore, the rat jumped off and thanked the octopus for saving his life and said 
that he left a little present on the octopus’s head.  When the octopus realized that there was a rat 
dropping on his head, he became extremely angry and told the rat, if I ever see you again, I’ll kill you.  
To this day, the octopus is mad about this and is still looking for the rat.

12.  S h a r k s 
 
 
We are fortunate not to have much of a “shark problem” in American Samoa.  Based on conversations 
with long-time residents here, it appears that there have been very few shark attacks in the Territory and 
probably no fatalities here in the past 30 years.  The few injuries that have occurred were usually related 
to fishing activities, and records from the hospital's Emergency Medical Services concur with this.  
EMS has responded to only one or two shark incidents in recent memory – one was a somewhat 
humorous account of two fishermen trying to land a shark in their boat.  The first fisherman brought the 
shark up to the side of the boat so that his partner could club it, but his partner missed.  The shark then 
reared up and bit the first fisherman, who then got mad and clubbed his partner for missing the shark. 
 
The sharks (malie) living in our nearshore 
waters are generally not dangerous to 
swimmers or divers.  The most commonly 
seen species are the blacktip reef shark 
(Carcharhinus melanopterus) and the 
whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus).  
These are not large sharks, usually about 4-
5 feet in length, although everyone swears 
that the one they saw was bigger.  They 
feed on fish and shellfish.  The whitetip has 
an unusual habit of resting occasionally on the seafloor during the daytime.  These two shark species are 
usually not aggressive but they may swim close by to see who's in their area.  But both are attracted to 
wounded and bleeding fish, which accounts for several shark encounters with divers who had tied 
speared fish around their waists.  Need it be suggested that this is not a smart thing to do? 
 
The blacktip is easily frightened away, but on rare occasions small blacktips will sometimes startle a 
person by swimming directly at them.  They look like a little torpedo coming straight at you, but other 
than your brief panic attack, no harm is done.  Another quirk of the adult blacktip is that, at night, it may 
charge at a diver's flashlight if the light shines on them for too long. 
 
Sightings of more dangerous sharks in our nearshore waters are rare, but over the years, a few tiger 
sharks have been seen or caught around Tutuila.  Also, hammerhead sharks are known to swim into 
Pago Pago Harbor, where some give birth to young and others are perhaps attracted there by the cannery 
wastes.  The large but non-dangerous whale shark has also seen near Taema Bank and a juvenile whale 
shark (4.1 m total length) washed up 
on Aunu’u island in 1989. 
 
So, yes indeed we have sharks in our 
shoreline waters, but most are not of 
serious concern.  Yet, someplace deep 
in our brain yells Danger! whenever 
we see one.  But it is still very exciting 
to see a shark swim by.  Our heart rate 
jumps, but then the shark is quickly 
gone, and our only thought is wow, 
did you see that?

13. The alogo surgeonfish -- ruler of the reeftop 
 
 
American Samoa's coral reefs are truly a wonder of nature.  Our sea is home to a very diverse and 
colorful assemblage of plants and animals.  Some 890 species of fish occur here, which is about twice 
the number of marine fish species found in Hawaii. 
 
At first glance, the reef seems to be an exotic panorama 
of mass confusion, complete with bizarre shapes of fish 
painted in psychedelic colors.  It's like looking into an 
overstocked aquarium.  But as you frequent the reef more 
often, you begin to notice some structure to the 
confusion.  Each species is generally found only in 
certain habitats such as shallow reef flats, sandy bottom 
areas, or deeper waters. 
 
Many individual fish even take up permanent residence at 
a particular site rather than roam around.  One particular 
fish I watched stayed at the same coral block for 3 years (it had a unique markings on its body, so I 
could easily identify it).  That coral block was home.   
 
Such stay-at-home behavior is actually quite common among coral reef fishes.  One abundant species on 
our reefs that does this is the alogo, also known as the blue-lined surgeonfish (Acanthurus lineatus) 
because of its knife-like blade located near its tail.  The blade is usually not visible because it is folded 
away into a groove in the fish's skin.  It is a bit poisonous, and careless handling of the fish may cause a 
puncture and painful swelling in your hand. 
 
The alogo grows about 8 inches long and 
weighs half a pound.  It is a very 
attractive fish, with bold yellow, blue, 
and black horizontal lines on its sides, 
although its basic color pattern can be 
swiftly altered depending on the alogo's 
mood.  For example, when the alogo 
becomes aggressive and chases another 
fish, its face and fins darken and it looks 
angry (to me at least). 
 
The alogo lives in the foamy surge zone 
where the waves crash against the reef.  
This is not an easy place to live, but the 
alogo is adept at it.  When a really rough 
wave hits, the alogo darts down into a 
hole or over the reef edge into the safety 
of deeper water.  
 
Like a lot of other reef fish, the alogo is a territorial animal, which means that it dwells at a particular 
patch of reef and protects that site from all other fish.  The territory of each alogo measures about 5 x 5 
feet.  There it feeds on the thin film of plant material (algae) that covers the reeftop and appears as a 
greenish grassy turf.  Because of their territorial nature, the alogo space themselves evenly across the 
Alogo in black-fin coloration as they compete for a new 
territory.  Note the substrate – that’s prime real estate 
with a good crop of turf algae that the alogo eat.

reeftop, and as they munch away on the algae-covered rocks, they remind me of a herd of miniature 
cows feeding in a distant pasture. 
 
Many other species of coral reef fish are also algae eaters, and two general patterns of feeding have 
evolved among these species.  One is for a species to become territorial and fiercely guard its own algal 
patch, the other is to be non-territorial and roam around the reef looking for an unguarded patch of algae 
to eat.  To an underwater observer, this dual approach to feeding is readily visible -- most of the reef is 
picked clean of all edible algae and looks like bare rock, except where a territorial fish guards its lush 
algal plot. 
 
The feisty alogo defends its plot from all competitors, so the turf algae grows well there and provides all 
the food the alogo needs.  Protection of this garden doesn't come cheaply, however.  The alogo must 
defend its territory every minute of the day from other fish that lurk nearby, waiting for a chance to 
sneak in and chow down.   
 
That's where the alogo's sharp blade comes in 
handy (see photo).  The alogo will threaten to 
viciously sideswipe an intruder with this weapon.  
Most other fish heed the alogo's warning and back-
off quickly.  It's mostly a bluffing game played 
repeatedly through the day, and rarely does anyone 
get hurt. 
 
Other aspects of the alogo's behavior are 
fascinating.  Every evening at dusk, all the alogo migrate off the reeftop to deeper waters where they 
will spend the night sleeping in crevices to escape being eaten by predators like sharks (malie) and jacks 
(malauli, ulua).  At dawn, they return by the same route.  Their migrations to and from the reeftop look 
like rush-hour traffic on an underwater highway.   
 
The alogo is a popular Samoan food fish and it is one the most important species of reef fish caught, 
accounting in some years for up to 30% (by weight) of all reef fish caught in the nearshore subsistence 
fishery.  Most are caught by spear fishermen, particularly at night when the fish are sleeping in reef 
crevices.  Daytime spear fishermen have a much harder time catching them, because the alogo tend to 
stay just out of spearing range.

14.  Manini and pone -- two favorite reef fish 
 
 
Manini and pone are two favorite food fishes found 
just about everywhere in shallow waters around the 
islands of American Samoa.  Like alogo, they belong 
to the family of fishes called surgeonfish because of 
their sharp knife blades that fit into grooves near 
their tail.  Manini and pone are rather meek fishes, 
however, and they do not seem to wield their 
weapons much. 
 
The manini (Acanthurus triostegus) is a small fish 
about 5 inches long.  Its coloration is yellow with 
vertical black bars, which looks a bit like a prisoner's 
uniform and that's why this fish is also called the convict tang. 
 
Manini often swim in large schools containing hundreds or thousands of individuals.  There are two 
good reasons for this schooling behavior -- it helps them escape predators and it also helps them get 
access to food.  First, when a large fish attacks a school of manini, the manini scatter in all directions 
like a shotgun blast.  This commotion momentarily confuses the predator and the manini get away. Each 
manini thus has a better chance of not getting eaten if it stays in a group. 
 
The manini also cleverly use their schooling 
behavior to get food.  They like to feed on the 
thin green algae turf that grows on reef rocks, 
but these algae patches are usually guarded 
fiercely by alogo surgeonfish and 
damselfishes (tu'u'u) who are nasty to 
intruders. 
 
Just the sight of a manini gets them livid with 
rage.  A single manini would not stand a 
chance to get by these guards, but a large 
group of manini can succeed.  The alogo and 
damselfishes are simply overwhelmed when 
hundreds of manini descend into their 
territory to feed.  While the alogo futilely 
chases one manini away, a hundred others are gobbling up its garden. 
 
Manini spawning is a spectacular event.  When conditions are right, thousands will assemble to spawn 
at a particular time and place.  They often spawn in or near the reef channel (ava) at dusk when the tide 
is high.  Their behavior and coloration are noticeably different at this time, as they swim around in a 
agitated fashion and change color to white with wider black bars.  This seething mass of fish mills about 
until they can't take the excitement any longer.  A group of them will suddenly burst upwards in the 
water column, spawn, and return to the seafloor again, all in a split second.  Although this happens fast, 
you can tell that the fish actually spawned because the milt expelled by the male fish looks like a puff of 
smoke from a gun.  When the spawning action really gets going, it looks like an underwater version of 
popcorn popping.

After spawning, the fertilized eggs drift away with the currents.  About one month later, the small 
manini that survived this larval stage are ready to settle back onto the reef. 
 
Pone (Ctenochaetus striatus, or the lined bristletooth surgeonfish) are a different type of surgeonfish in 
two respects.  They are a dull brown color and they have funny teeth.  Their lack of spectacular 
coloration is somewhat of an embarrassment in tropical waters which are renown for brightly colored 
fish.  Pone are, however, one of the most abundant fishes on the reefs, so they must be doing something 
right. 
 
Their teeth have evolved very differently from 
other surgeonfishes because what they feed 
upon is quite different.  Instead of having actual 
teeth to bite off algae the way that alogo and 
manini do, pone have a mouthful of bristles 
which they use as a comb or brush to collect the 
detritus that lies on reef surfaces.  The detritus 
they eat includes all the small bits and pieces of 
formerly living plants and animals.  The detritus 
in your backyard, for example, might include 
grass clippings, old ulu leaves, decaying 
coconut husks, rotting papayas, and numerous 
unseen dead insects.  Not a pretty meal, to be 
sure. 
 
Detritus is found everywhere, but few large animals can make a meal out 
of it.  Pone can, and that may account for their abundance and widespread 
distribution on coral reefs. 
 
Every several years or so, pone have a very successful spawning event, 
and uncountable numbers of their young (pala'ia) settle onto the reef.  
Pala’ia are very pretty and look like small dark alogo.  But their beauty 
fades as they grow, and in just a few weeks they turn brown in color.

15.  Old fish caught locally 
 
 
This is hard to believe -- an 18 year old alogo was caught in American Samoa.  That's old enough to get 
a drivers license.  
 
We're talking about the alogo, also known as the blue-lined surgeonfish Acanthurus lineatus.  Nothing 
unusual about its size -- it was the typical 8-inch alogo you see in the stores.  And I ate it.  All that 
remained were the little bones that scientists use to determine the age of the fish.  These bones, when 
looked at under a microscope, have concentric circles, one for each year, just like tree rings.  You just 
count the rings and that's how old the fish is. 
 
What's even more astonishing is that an alogo caught in 
Australia's Great Barrier Reef was 44 years old.  I am not 
kidding.  There were also other alogo in the Australian 
sample that were 20-40 years old, so the record age of 44 is 
believable.  These old fish were not unusually large, just 
the standard size alogo. 
 
It turns out that this is not unusual for coral reef fish.  
Recent studies show that several other species of 
surgeonfish (pone), unicornfish (ume), groupers (gatala) and snappers (mu) can also live up to 20-40 
years.  These findings are beginning to reshape our understanding about the ecology of coral reef fishes 
and their vulnerability to overfishing.  The occurrence of many long-lived fish in a population indicates 
that the coral reef fish community is quite stable, with a low replacement of individual fish.  Once a 
young fish gets to the reef, it may be there for decades. 
 
Why would these fish live so long?  The answer provides some key information about the environment 
that the fish live in.  Fish typically exhibit this type of life cycle (long life span and repeat spawning) 
when few of their young survive.  That's certainly the case for coral reef fish – their thousands of eggs 
and larvae drift around with the ocean currents for weeks or months.  Very few of them make it back to 
the reefs.  So, if all their young usually die, the adult fish need to live a long time and spawn repeatedly 
to make sure that at least some young survive.  If the adults lived 
only a short time, the population might disappear altogether. 
 
Every so often however, during years when the ocean currents and 
conditions are just right, massive numbers of young fish survive and 
appear on our reefs, like pala'ia (young pone surgeonfish) or i'asina 
(young goatfish). 
 
While this is all very interesting of course, there is an important take-
home message.  It is easy to overfish populations with these life 
history characteristics.  Having a long life span and spawning 
repeatedly may be a successful strategy under natural conditions, but 
it also makes these fish extra vulnerable to overfishing.  That's 
because fishermen tend to harvest the larger (older) fish in the 
population.  Under heavy fishing pressure, all the old fish may be 
taken, leaving only the smaller, younger fish.  That would put the 
population in a very precarious situation, because the younger fish 
left may not yet be old enough to spawn.

That appears to be exactly what has happened in 
American Samoa  because there are relatively few and/or 
small sizes of the species commonly taken for food left on 
our reefs.  The graph at right shows the pooled lengths of 
all surgeonfish, unicornfish, parrotfish, snappers, 
emperors, groupers, jacks and sharks sighted during 
extensive scientific surveys on the reef slope at the 30-ft 
depth.  Few fish were 16 inches (40 cm) or larger.  This 
depressing picture is not a sudden event – surveys in 1996 
and 2004 show similar results. 
 
Even though current levels of fishing do not seem 
excessive, the area of our reefs is rather small and 
consequently it is easily fished out.  Fish stocks may well have been depleted years ago – 
knowledgeable locals and elder Samoans recall seeing far more fish on our reefs 25 years ago. 
 
A meaningful recovery will require nothing short of a territory-wide reduction in the harvest of coral 
reef fishes for at least 10 years, with specific protection for the larger fish.  That’s what the long life 
span of the fish is telling us.  There is no quick fix.  Additionally, setting aside some areas as marine 
protected areas is an essential component for the recovery of fish stocks.  To be effective, such areas 
must provide long-term protection by being permanently closed to all fishing.  Marine protected areas 
that are periodically opened up to fishing may satisfy short-term goals, but they do not allow the fish to 
grow big and old, and it is these old-timers that produce the most fish eggs.  For example, one large 
snapper (mu) 24 inches long releases as many eggs as 212 snappers that are 17 inches long. 
 
So, that 18 year old alogo was not just an unusual trophy – it was also a vital member of the fish 
community that spawned year after year, thereby insuring that some young fish survived to maintain a 
healthy population of alogo on our reefs. 
                                                                                                                                  
Two fisheries in American Samoa currently target coral reef fish 
-- the subsistence fishery and the artisanal (small-scale 
commercial) fishery.  Subsistence fishing includes the multiple 
ways that Samoans have always caught nearshore fish for food.  
In modern times, this includes rod and reel, bamboo pole and 
line, free-diving, throw nets, gillnets, and gleaning (hand-
picking clams and octopus).  Stone weirs for atule and enu 
baskets for juvenile goatfish (i’asina) are still used in Manu’a.  
On Tutuila, subsistence catches appear to be modest in size and 
have been declining steadily over the past 20 years due to 
lifestyle changes (more people have regular jobs). 
                                                                                                                                
The artisanal fishery that sells reef fish to local stores is a 
relatively recent development.  It is conducted by teams of night 
divers who use underwater flashlights and spears to catch 
sleeping fish.  In the mid 1990s, many of these divers switched 
from free-diving to scuba diving, which greatly increased the 
number of fish they caught.  This type of heavy fishing had a 
significant overfishing impact on our reef fish populations, so 
the use of scuba gear while spear fishing was banned in the 
Territory in 2001.

16.  Tuna 
 
 
The ocean around us supports a variety of offshore fishes, 
such as masimasi (mahimahi), swordfish, wahoo and marlin, 
but by far the most commercially important of these pelagic 
fishes are the tunas.  The most common in our local waters are 
albacore (apakoa), yellowfin (asiasi), skipjack (atu) and 
dogtooth tuna (tagi) .  
 
Dogtooth tuna are occasionally seen near shore, but tuna 
prefer the open ocean and are wide-ranging species.  These 
ultra-streamlined fish undertake impressive oceanic travels -- 
one skipjack caught here had been tagged near Australia over 
2000 miles away.  But the general movements of tuna in our 
area are not known. 
 
Local fishermen catch tuna in our area by trolling at FADs 
(fish aggregation devices), offshore seamounts, or wherever 
seabird flocks are feeding (the flocks indicate the presence of 
baitfish that the tuna are probably also feeding upon).  In 
recent years, commercial catches of locally-caught tuna have 
increased in the longline fishery that targets albacore using 
long lengths (extending 5-40 miles) of monofilament longline 
with baited hooks. 
 
Given that American Samoa has two major tuna canneries and 
we are the No. 1 port in the United States in terms of value of 
fish landed (about $200,000,000 per year), it is somewhat 
surprising to realize that few of the fish canned here are 
actually caught within American Samoa's waters.  That's 
because tuna are not particularly abundant in our area, so 
local catches delivered to the canneries are a small fraction of 
the 200,000 tons of tuna processed at the canneries each year.  
Commercial quantities of tuna are generally located 1000s of 
miles away from American Samoa, so the big purse seiners 
and foreign longliners that you see docked in Pago Pago 
Harbor generally do not fish locally.  Instead, they must 
travel for about 1 week just to reach their distant fishing 
grounds.  The reason why these boats deliver their catch to 
the canneries here is simply because the tuna canned in 
American Samoa can enter US markets tariff-free as “Made 
in USA”, and the US is one of the largest consumers of tuna. 
 
A rather enjoyable feature about tuna is that their meat generally lacks parasites, so people eat raw tuna 
in a variety of forms (oka, sashimi).

17.  Turtles In trouble 
 
 
In Samoan folklore, sea turtles were believed to have the power to save fishermen who were lost at sea 
by bringing them safely to shore.  The Samoan word for sea turtle, “I'a sa,” translates literally to “sacred 
fish”, presumably because of this ability. 
 
Samoans have traditionally harvested sea turtles for food, and the shell 
was often made into bracelets, combs, fishing hooks, and also was used 
in the headpiece worn by a princess during important dance 
ceremonies.  Turtles were incorporated into Samoan songs and art, and 
there are even turtle petroglyphs (rock carvings) in Faga'itua and 
Leone.  And, of course, there's the legend about the Turtle and Shark 
that appear in the sea at Vaitogi when villagers sing a special song. 
 
It therefore seems extra unfortunate that turtle numbers in Samoa have 
declined so much that they are now considered endangered species.  
Although it is difficult to determine how many are left, it is clear that 
few females lay eggs each year in the Territory.  This drop parallels the worldwide decline of sea turtles 
due to overharvest, loss of nesting beaches, and incidental kills in fishing gear.  Pacific populations of 
one of our species (hawksbills) are “rapidly approaching extinction” according to a recent scientific 
review. 
 
Two turtle species, the green and hawksbill, are the most frequently found turtles in our local waters.  
The hawksbill or “laumei uga” (Eretmochelys imbricata) is usually the species that nests on Tutuila 
beaches.  This is a solitary nester, and perhaps only 1 or 2 hawksbill females now use a suitable beach.  
The hawksbill is occasionally poisonous -- in the late 1950s, people in Aunu'u got very sick after eating 
one. 
 
Our other species is the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), named after the color of its fat.  It is also 
found around our islands, but it nests primarily at Rose Atoll.  These long-lived turtles have rather 
complicated life cycles that involve repeated 
long-distance migrations to and from 
American Samoa.  They start life as eggs 
buried in beach sand.  Once a female has laid 
her first group of about 100 eggs, she will 
return at 2-week intervals to lay more.  In 
about 60 days, the eggs hatch and the little 
turtles dart into the ocean.  Where they go is 
not known, but eventually they take up 
residence at some feeding area that may be 
far away from American Samoa. 
 
There they remain for some 20-25 years until 
they become sexually mature, at which time 
they return to the very same beach where they 
came from.  After laying eggs there, the adult females then turn around and go back to their distant 
feeding grounds.  That's the basic pattern for most sea turtle species throughout the world.  Swim far 
away to some nesting beach, then swim back to their feeding area, back and forth every few years 
thereafter.

We have some very interesting migration data for green sea turtles at Rose Atoll (see map below), 
where a tagging study was conducted in the mid-1990s.  In all, 10 tagged turtles were recovered after 
nesting at the atoll.  Eight swam 800 miles directly to Fiji (unfortunately two of them were eaten when 
they got there).  Another went past Fiji to Vanuatu, and the last one went in the completely opposite 
direction to French Polynesia near Tahiti. 
 
It's understandable why the adult turtles do not stay at Rose Atoll after nesting, because their favorite 
food (seagrass) is absent there.  But I wonder why don't they just stay in Fiji where they have both 
seagrass and nesting beaches. 
 
Anyway, this pattern of large-scale movements between a turtle's nesting area and feeding area means 
that turtle stocks in the South Pacific Ocean are all mixed together.  While some of “our” turtles were 
caught in Fiji, the reciprocal is also true -- turtles that feed in our waters probably originated from 
islands elsewhere in the South Pacific.  This mixing greatly complicates conservation efforts.  It means 
that region-wide cooperation among the island countries of the South Pacific is essential; otherwise, 
while we try to protect turtles in American Samoa, our turtles may be killed later when they migrate to 
other islands. 
 
Tough federal and territorial laws exist in American Samoa to protect turtles and their eggs, because 
they are an endangered species.  Depending on the circumstances, there is a $500 to $250,000 penalty 
and up to one year in jail, for killing a turtle or importing any turtle product into the Territory (shells, 
stuffed turtles, turtle combs, etc.).  Fortunately fewer turtles seem to be taken in American Samoa, 
probably due to their scarcity but also due to outreach programs that inform children and villagers about 
the endangered status of the turtles. 
 
In addition to education efforts, we must protect both the turtles and their 
habitat.  Sandy beaches are essential for turtle nesting areas, so hauling sand 
away from our beaches results in the loss of critical habitat for these species.  
No beaches, no nesting turtles. 
 
Although some villagers may still like to eat turtle meat and eggs, the point to 
remember is that turtles are a disappearing resource in American Samoa.  
They are a part of Samoa's heritage and need to be vigorously protected, or 
they may be lost altogether.  It is a sad commentary that many young 
Samoans have never even seen a live sea turtle.

18.  Baby turtles:  look but don't touch! 
 
 
Baby sea turtles.  They’re so neat -- 
perfectly formed miniatures, all racing 
down the beach together to get into the 
water.  Kids think they’re cute and they 
want to keep them as pets, and plenty of 
parents think baby turtles make great pets.  
After all, they don’t bark or fight, and 
they’re so tiny so they don’t take up much 
space.  They don’t eat much, either. 
 
Also, some people in American Samoa 
believe that when a nest of turtles hatches 
and all the babies run to the sea, their 
mothers are waiting out on the reef to eat 
them!  Because of this misguided belief, 
some people collect baby turtles and keep them at home or release them on a different beach.  But the 
very best thing we can do for baby turtles is:  LEAVE THEM ALONE! 
 
Many years of scientific research on sea turtles have taught us that mother turtles do not eat their babies.  
Adult turtles eat mostly seagrass, algae (seaweed), and sea sponges (the living kind, NOT the kitchen 
kind).  In fact, after the female turtle has laid eggs (sometimes two or three times in the space of a few 
weeks), she goes back out to the sea and leaves the area.  For example, after nesting at Rose Atoll, some 
of American Samoa's green sea turtles swam to Fiji  – over 800 miles away!  So, those of you with good 
intentions out there, rest assured that mom will not be eating her babies, and you do not need to collect 
the baby turtles from the beach to save them from her. 
 
It is true that baby turtles do have predators, such as large fishes and sharks.  Nature provides the turtles 
with some protection however:  (1) most turtles hatch at night when predators might have difficulty 
seeing them, (2) baby turtles are dark-colored, 
and this “cryptic coloration” enables them to be 
camouflaged as they swim over the reef, (3) 
female turtles can lay over 100 eggs in a single 
nest — when this many turtles hatch at the same 
time, a big jack (ulua) or shark (malie) can’t 
possibly catch and eat all of them, so some have a 
chance to hide in the reef.  This is called 
“predator swamping” and is common among 
reptiles (lizards, snakes, turtles, etc.).  For this 
reason it is a bad idea to take “just a few” baby 
turtles away, and release them later.  The 
“predator swamping” effect is lost and those baby 
turtles will probably end up as some fish's lunch. 
 
A critical reason to leave baby turtles on the beach is that THAT EXACT BEACH is very important to 
them.  Baby turtles remember or “imprint on” the beach where they hatched.  Like many animals, turtles 
have little natural magnets in their brains that allow them to home-in on their native beach.  Years later 
when it’s time for them to reproduce, adult turtles, with their internal “homing devices”, will seek that 
same beach.  If hatchling turtles are removed from their home beaches and kept in someone’s bathtub or

NATURAL HISTORY GUIDE
 
 
37
bucket, chances are they will become confused and 
have little chances of surviving, let alone finding 
their home beach later (that is, if they don’t just die 
in the bucket). 
 
Sea turtles have been around for millions of years 
and survived just fine before humans started taking 
their babies off the beach, whether to “protect” 
them or otherwise.  Newly-hatched turtles, just like 
their gigantic moms and dads, are wild animals and 
are not meant to be kept as pets.  The ocean 
provides better food and a cleaner, healthier 
environment for turtles than humans can.  
 
Turtles are far-ranging animals that swim thousands and thousands of miles in the sea during their 
lifetimes.  When they go to their nesting islands, they meet with other turtles, mate, lay eggs, and so 
keep their species alive.  Every time a female sea turtle finds her way back to the beach where she was 
born and nests there, she completes the ancient, natural cycle that keeps sea turtles alive on Earth.  
Imagine a turtle imprisoned in a bucket, tub, or garbage can, swimming endlessly in tiny circles, never 
to see the open ocean, never to meet another turtle, never to help its species survive. 
 
Sea turtles all over the world are dwindling in number.  All species are listed as threatened or 
endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, including our own green and hawksbill sea turtles.  
If we want our children and grandchildren to be able to see these huge, magnificent sea turtles 
swimming alive and free in the ocean, where they belong, we have to do our best to protect them now.  
The very best way we can to do that is by protecting the beaches where they nest, letting the baby turtles 
find their own way into the sea, and not hunting the big turtles.  Future generations of turtles (and 
people) will thank us.

19.  Whales  Ho ! 
 
 
September and October are the peak months when humpback whales (tafola) visit our balmy waters.  
It's almost impossible not to get excited when one is spotted.  Most of us feel inexplicably privileged for 
a brief glimpse into their mysterious world, and there's an uncontrollable urge to shout 'thar she blows'. 
 
Part of our fascination with whales is their 
huge size, of course.  Adult humpbacks 
(Megaptera novaeangliae) grow up to 50 
feet long and weigh about 40 metric tons 
(which equals the combined weight of 200 
sumo wrestlers).  We rarely get a chance to 
see the whole whale, except when they 
make a spectacular leap (“breach”) out of 
the water.  We usually see only their air 
spout or their humped back as they prepare 
to dive. 
 
Humpbacks are air-breathing mammals (like ourselves) that live their complete lives in the ocean. They 
reproduce like all land mammals, but they do it underwater.  Whales obviously have to make sure that 
their babies don't drown while being born.  Mother whales nurse their young for about a year. 
 
These whales eat small schooling fishes and krill (small shrimps).  They feed by gulping in tons of 
water in a single mouthful, and then strain the food out as they expel the water.  The out-going water is 
filtered through specialized structures called “baleen”, which looks (with a little imagination) like a 
mouthful of coconut fronds.  Humpbacks lack real teeth because they have no need to bite or chew their 
tiny food items.  It seems odd that the whale, which is one of the world's largest animals ever, feeds on 
such small things. 
 
The appearance of humpbacks in Samoa is an important segment of their grand migration up and down 
the South Pacific Ocean. During the warm months of the southern hemisphere, our whales feed in the 
rich waters of Antarctica, located 3,200 miles to the south of us (see map).  Biologists call this particular 
group of whales “Stock-E” (formerly called “Group-5”).  When Antarctic's bitter winter sets in, Stock-E 
whales seek warmer waters.  They migrate northward, with some going towards Australia and others 
migrating towards Tonga.  Apparently most of this latter group 
remains near Tonga, but at least some migrate onward to 
Samoa.  However, one of our whales was sighted near Tahiti, 
so their migration patterns still hold some surprises for us. 
 
A few humpbacks might arrive in Samoa as early as July or 
leave here as late as December, but they are most common 
here in September and October.  They occur in small groups of 
adults or in mother-calf pairs.  Humpbacks have been sighted 
around all 7 of the islands in the Territory, but we don't know 
how many are actually here.  They migrate here to mate and 
give birth to their young.  And, interestingly, they stop feeding 
while here -- only when they return to the Antarctic do they 
resume feeding.

While an occasional spout of whale-breath 
can be seen in our local waters, you can also 
hear the whales if you stick your head in the 
water.  Humpbacks are famous for their 
unique “songs”.  Yes, whales sing!  During 
mating season, male humpbacks sing to 
either attract females or to defend their 
territory from other male whales, much like 
birds do with their own songs. 
 
The whale's song is haunting and complex.  
It sounds like a eerie series of chirps, 
squeaks, whistles and grunts.  I know that “grunts” don't seem like they could make much of a song, but 
you just have to take my word for it.  It is unlike anything you have ever heard.  Scuba divers can hear 
the singing if the they hold their breath and pay attention.  Snorkelers can also hear the songs, but they 
have to dive about 10 feet deep to get below the noisy surface layer of water.  The song lasts about 10-
20 minutes, it has a beginning, middle and end, and all males of the same stock sing the same song.  
Biologists can therefore identify where a whale comes from by listening to its song.  For example, 
Hawaiian humpbacks sing a different song (than the Samoan humpbacks), because they belong to a 
different stock of whales that migrates between Hawaii and Alaska.  The whales' song is one of the 
world's wonders of nature and it's at our doorstep. 
 
Humpback whales are currently listed as an endangered species 
because their world-wide populations were decimated by whalers in 
the 1800's and 1900's.  By the time commercial whaling was stopped 
in 1966, 95% of our stock (Stock-E) had been killed.  Recovery of 
these whales has been unexpectedly slow, probably due to continued 
whaling by Soviet factory ships as late as 1972 and a subsistence 
harvest of these whales occurred in Tonga up to 1978.  In any event, 
whales in American Samoa remain few in number, and in some years 
hardly any are seen here. 
 
Because humpbacks use our waters to give birth to their young, it is 
important to protect them when they are here.  Enjoy their presence, 
but don't pester them.  Avoid the temptation to boat right up to them 
or follow them at close quarters.  Boaters, divers and swimmers 
should stay at least 100 yards away, and watch from there.

22.  Flying Foxes (fruit bats) 
 
 
Large flying foxes, also know as fruit bats, are one of the more unusual 
animals in American Samoa, especially for visitors from areas where 
bats are small and rarely seen.  Three species inhabit our islands – two 
large fruit bats (Pteropus samoensis, P. tonganus) and a small insect-
eating bat (Emballonura semicaudata).  These three are the only native 
mammals in the Samoan islands.   
 
The two flying foxes are especially distinctive:  they are renowned for being large (with a wing span up 
to 3 feet wide) and active both day and night.  Pteropus samoensis (pe'a vao) is commonly called the 
Samoan flying fox.  It is presently found only in the Samoan Archipelago and Fiji.  It once occurred in 
Tonga but is now extinct there.  The other flying fox, Pteropus tonganus (pe'a fanua), has several 
common names such as the Insular, White-naped, White-necked or Tongan fruit bat.  It has a wider 
distribution in the Pacific, ranging from islands off Papua New Guinea to the Cook Islands. 
 
In American Samoa, flying foxes can be seen flying, soaring, feeding, or just hanging in trees.  
Although individuals of the two species overlap in size (adults weigh 300-600 grams), there are ways to 
differentiate them from a distance.  When silhouetted against the sky, the pe'a vao has a more triangular 
shape, with wings that are slightly scalloped and relatively dark and opaque.  Their flight appears more 
relaxed, usually with slower wing beats and deeper wing strokes.  It is not unusual to observe them 
soaring in the air in the day, taking advantage of rising currents of warm air (thermals) to seemingly 
float up and about without flapping their wings. 
 
In contrast, pe'a fanua has a more cross-like appearance:  the neck and head appear more pronounced, 
the wings are narrower and more scalloped, and the hind legs stretch out like a tail.  In flight, pe'a fanua 
tend to have faster wing beats and shallower wing strokes.  They are less likely to soar in thermals and 
generally take a directional route to and from roosting sites at dawn or dusk.

Despite these differences, it takes keen eye to distinguish the two species from a distance.  Close up, the 
pe'a vao may sport a white to yellowish triangular patch that starts from the forehead and extends to the 
back of its head, or it may simply exhibit a generally grayish head with or without flecks of white hair

(much like a graying man).  Its neck and shoulder areas are a beautiful russet brown, while the rest of 
the body has a dusty black appearance.  The pe'a fanua, on the other hand, has a basically black head 
and body.  These black areas serve to set off a distinctive band of creamy yellow on the back of the neck 
and which extends slightly below its shoulders as if in a cape.  This explains why they are called white-
naped fruit bats although the color is not really white. 
 
The two species have quite different social behaviors.  During the daytime, pe'a fanua form large 
roosting groups or colonies of hundreds to thousands of bats.  These colonies are generally organized 
according to their reproductive status and may be composed of bachelor males, clusters of females 
defended by an adult male (suggesting a harem mating system), or groups of females and their young.  
In any case, individuals appear to be relatively “faithful” to their roosts, usually returning to their 
respective colonies following foraging flights.   
 
But the pe'a vao does not do this.  Instead, these bats 
usually roost singly on branches, or as pairs of males 
and females (suggesting a monogamous mating 
system), or as a female with its young.  When 
roosting, pe'a vao males tend to hang from exposed 
or dead branches of trees on ridge tops while females 
roost in more covered positions on forest slopes.  
 
There is little information on how long flying foxes 
live, although some held in captivity have lived 20 
years.  We assume that they live shorter lives in the 
wild, because natural catastrophes like tropical 
cyclones may periodically reduce their numbers, as 
occurred in the early 1990s.  With proper 
management and protection from hunting, the 
populations will generally bounce back but this requires a number of years, because females of both 
species probably have only one young per year and we do not know how many of their young survive to 
adulthood. 
 
The care and energy that both bat species put into their young is remarkable.  Pregnancy lasts 
approximately 5 months in both species, and once the young are born, it takes at least another 3 months 
before they are weaned.  Even after they are capable of flight, the young continue to receive parental 
care, perhaps until they reach adult size or become reproductively active themselves.  We know this 
from observations of pairs of individuals seen to alight independently on the same tree and subsequently 
come together with one individual (presumably the juvenile) being wrapped up in the other's wings as 
they settle down to roost.  Sightings of pregnant females and individuals carrying young in flight 
indicate that pe'a vao give birth mostly between April and June.  Pe'a fanua births appear to occur year-
round but are more common in January and June to August. 
 
Although their name indicates that they are fruit-eaters, both species also eat nectar, pollen, leaves, and 
sap.  They tend to consume only the “juice” of fruits and leaves.  To do this, a bat will carefully chew on 
food (usually eating around large seeds), press the pulp against the roof of its mouth with its tongue, 
squeeze and suck in the juice, then spit out most of the pulp in pellets called “ejecta.”  These ejecta are 
especially abundant under breadfruit trees (ulu) where the bats have been feeding overnight.  Among the 
splatter of mushy bits of the fruit, you can find these pellets of drier material that sometimes show tooth 
and palatal (roof of the mouth) impressions, much like a dental cast produced at a dentist’s clinic.  
Ejecta pellets help us to identify food items that bats eat even when we do not directly observe them 
feeding.  In addition to direct observations and analysis of ejecta, their diets are also determined through

pollen present in facial hair and in feces.  These data help 
scientists determine which plants are important because they are 
preferred, nutritious and/or available year-round. 
 
At least 42 plant species provide food for the pe'a vao and pe'a 
fanua in American Samoa.  These consist mostly of forest tree 
species, such as aoa (Ficus prolixa and Ficus obliqua), asi 
(Syzigium inophylloides), a’amati’e (Elaeocarpus ulianus), ifi 
(Inocarpus fagifer), fetau (Callophyllum inophyllum), mamalava 
(Planchonella samoensis), and tava (Pometia pinnata).  The bats 
also eat fruits grown by man such as mango (Mangifera indica) 
and ulu (Artocarpus altilis), but damage to crops is limited if 
fruits are harvested before they ripen on the tree.  Also, when 
you hear the bats squealing in banana patches at night, it’s 
usually because they are fighting over the banana flowers, not 
the fruits.  Despite the broad similarity in their diets, pe'a fanua 
exploit flower resources and feed on trees (especially domestic 
ones) closer to human habitations more often than do pe'a vao. 
 
The rewards of the interaction between flying foxes and plants are certainly not one-sided, because the 
plants and forest also benefit from being visited by bats.  When the pe'a fanua visit patches of vavae 
flowers (Ceiba pentandra), for example, they help transfer pollen from one tree to another and that, in 
turn, enhances fruit formation and production.  Flying foxes are also important for seed dispersal.  When 
they consume fruits with small seeds (such as aoa), some seeds that get swallowed do not get digested 
but are carried and deposited away from the tree source.  In American Samoa, flying foxes are the only 
animals that can carry fruits with large seeds, such as 
ifi, over distances and uphill.  Studies of bat 
movements on Tutuila reveal that bats may commute 
between feeding areas up to 40 km apart during a 
single night.  Seeds that are transported can colonize 
naturally bare or cleared areas and aid in the 
revegetation of gaps in forests where trees may have 
fallen from disease, age, or bad weather. 
 
It may bother us that flying foxes eat some of the fruit 
that we grow for ourselves, but these bats are tireless 
workers that help maintain the health of our 
rainforest, and they are fun to watch.

23.  Banyan trees -- lifeline for Samoa's wildlife 
 
 
In the complex world of the Samoan rainforest, each of our native plants and wildlife contributes a 
unique and essential part.  Just as the beauty of a hymn would be less without the harmonies of different 
voices, so the beauty of the Samoan forests would be less if any of our plants or animals were lost.  And 
yet, as in a choir, there are a few natural “voices” that sing out above the rest.  These are the plants and 
animals most important for the harmony of Samoa's natural world.  Foremost among these are the aoa, 
or banyan trees. 
 
Banyans are fascinating plants.  Now, a lot of people don't 
think of plants as “fascinating”.  After all, they just sit 
there, right?  Well, not banyans.  Although banyans give 
life to countless animals by feeding them with their fruit, all 
banyans start out as killers -- stranglers, to be exact.  
Another name for the banyan is “strangler fig”.    
 
The aoa is a member of the fig family.  They earn the other 
part of their name by their strange way of growing.  Most 
plants, of course, sprout from seeds that have fallen to the 
ground, and grow up toward the sun.  Banyans usually do 
the opposite: they sprout from seeds that have been left by 
birds high in a tree, and grow down toward the ground.  
The seedling first anchors itself by sending roots into the little pocket of decaying leaves or moss where 
it has sprouted, then it wraps more and more roots around the tree that supports it, called the “host” tree.  
Soon the banyan's roots are spreading down the trunk, and finally they reach all the way to the ground.  
By then the fate of the host tree is sealed.  It is literally buried beneath the growing banyan -- strangled 
to death.  Eventually the body of the host tree decays away, leaving no trace behind, except sometimes a 
long hollow extending up inside the middle of the full-grown banyan.  Because banyans will start life on 
almost any type of host tree, they kill very few of any particular kind, and so are no threat to other plant 
species.  Still, they're rather...fascinating, don't you think? 
 
In Samoa, we have two different kinds of native banyan trees, both called aoa.  One kind (Ficus 
prolixa) becomes a huge tree, with an enormous spreading trunk that seems to be a twisted net of many 
smaller trunks.  This kind of banyan has green fruit.  The stronghold of this kind of banyan in American 
Samoa was the Tafuna Plain, where hundreds of the huge trees used to grow.  Today, only a small 
fraction remain.  Most have been cut down to make room for the uncontrolled development in this part 
of Tutuila.  Fortunately, a few magnificent trees still survive.  
 
The other kind of aoa (Ficus obliqua) is usually much smaller and does not have such a spreading form.  
Its trunk usually looks more “normal”, though it may have a hollow inside.  This type of banyan seems 
to favor cliffs and steep slopes, although it can also be found on flat land.  It doesn't always start life as a 
strangler, but sometimes grows up by itself.  The easiest way to recognize this kind of aoa is its fruit, 
which is orange or red when ripe. 
 
There is also an introduced kind of banyan tree in Samoa, the pulu.  This tree, originally from Asia, is 
usually planted along the coast in villages; a large one grows next to the public market in Fagatogo.  
Pulu trees differ from aoa trees by their much larger leaves and larger, fuzzy red fruit.  Although pulu 
are handsome trees that are useful for stabilizing our coasts, their fruits are not favored by wildlife, and 
so they do not play an important role in Samoa's natural symphony.

In contrast, both kinds of aoa are very important for wildlife.  In fact, a good case can be made that they 
are the most important tree species for the fruit-eating birds and bats of Samoa.  There are two reasons 
why they are so important.  First, they produce enormous amounts of fruit.  When one of the huge 
banyans has crop of fruit, its spreading crown has room for a whole army of hungry  fruit-eaters.  In a 
single tree, I have seen three lupe (Pacific Pigeons), eight manutagi (Purple-capped Fruit-Doves), four 
manuma (Many-colored Fruit-Doves), a dozen fuia (Samoan Starling), scattered iao (Wattled 
Honeyeaters) and miti vao (Polynesian Starlings) -- all at the same time.  No other Samoan trees provide 
such a feast.  The second reason why banyans are so important is that they fruit at all times of year.  
Most kinds of large forest trees have a definite fruiting season:  for example, asi tends to fruit from 
April to July, but some banyans have ripe fruit every month of the year.  Between 10-30% of banyan 
trees have ripe fruit in any given month.  This means that a fruit-eater can always find banyan fruit, even 
if all other fruits were out of season. 
 
One Samoan bird has come to depend on the reliable 
banyan.  This is the manuma, or Many-colored Fruit-Dove, 
one of the rarest birds on Tutuila.  In two years of 
observation, I have recorded manuma eating fruit on 99 
occasions.  In 98 of these 99 times, the manuma were 
eating banyan fruit (the one exception was berries of the 
soga bush).  One probable reason why the manuma is so 
rare today is the loss of many banyan trees, particularly in 
the Tafuna Plain.  If this bird is to survive here, it is 
essential that banyan trees be protected, and, if possible, 
increased in number. 
 
In addition to their important role in feeding wildlife, aoa trees also provide homes for many animals.  
Lulu (Barn Owls) frequently sleep and nest in the hollow trunks.  Tava'e (tropicbirds) find large nesting 
shelters, and fuia (Samoan Starlings) and ti'otala (White-collared Kingfisher) find protected nest holes.  
From its open, sheltered base to its spreading, fruit-laden crown, a banyan tree is a haven for wildlife. 
 
Sadly, banyans today are under threat in American Samoa.  Many were severely damaged by cyclones 
in 1990-91.  Many others have been cut down, and more are threatened by continued development, 
particularly in the Tafuna Plain.  Some of the most magnificent banyans that still stand have been make 
into gigantic trash barrels, their hollow trunks filled with mounds of used diapers and rusting cans.  This 
garbage is sometimes burned, which can kill the banyan even if that is not intended. 
 
What can you do?  Give banyans the respect and protection they deserve.  If your family is lucky 
enough to have an aoa on your land, please take care of it.  Don't cut it, burn it , or use it as a garbage 
dump.  If you notice a young banyan getting started, help it along by clearing away vines.  If you know 
someone who has a banyan on their land, talk to them about its importance for wildlife.  The banyan is a 
living testimony to the bounty and riches of Samoan nature, and is a lifeline for our wildlife.

24.  Natural foods for wildlife 
 
 
An animal's place in its environment is determined, more than anything else, by what it eats.  By 
studying what the birds and bats of American Samoa eat, and when those different foods are available, 
we are better able to develop plans to manage and conserve our wildlife and to help these animals in a 
crisis, such as after a tropical cyclone. 
 
Most animals can be grouped by what and how many kinds of foods they eat.  Animals that eat many 
different things are called generalists, while those that eat only one or a few foods are called specialists.  
True specialization is often a two-way dependency:  an animal depends on a plant for food, and the 
plant depends on that animal to help it disperse its seeds.  On remote islands like American Samoa, there 
is often not that much of any one kind of food, and cyclones can cause serious shortages of the foods 
that are available, so it is usually not a good idea for either a plant or an animal to rely on only one other 
creature.  We have few bird or bat species that are specialists in American Samoa. 
 
The technical word for the generalist, “omnivore”, literally means “eats everything”.  Humans probably 
have the broadest diet of any animal -- we happily eat meat, leaves, seeds, fruit, and fungus -- not to 
mention Bongos.  Animals that are most likely to survive in new environments, like when they first 
arrived on Tutuila, are often omnivores.  A good example is the rat (isumu), which can eat fruit, eggs, 
crabs, fungi and probably many other things.  
 
“Carnivores” are those species that eat almost exclusively other animals.  We usually think of 
carnivores as fierce hunters, like wolves or lions, but actually any animal that eats other animals is a 
carnivore.  The Barn Owl, or lulu, is the only Samoan animal that hunts other birds and mammals, but 
we have lots of other carnivores, including all our fish-eating birds and even our many animals that eat 
insects. 
 
“Herbivore” is a description of those animals that eat only plants.  This is a very general term, so it is 
better to specify what part of a plant is eaten, whether leaves, fruits, or nectar.  Each kind of animal 
usually is good at eating only one, or at most two, of these parts of a plant, because they are so different.  
For example, to rely on leaves, you need strong teeth to grind up the tough fibers, and a big stomach to 
process all that material.  Cows and horses are well equipped for the job.  At the other extreme, to rely 
on nectar (the sweet liquid inside of flowers), you need to be 
able to zip between lots of flowers and reach inside to suck up 
the small amount of juice in each one.  Nectar-feeders tend to be 
small and energetic, with long beaks or tongues to reach inside 
flowers.  Finally, to eat fruit, you need to be able to travel long 
distances, since trees with fruit are often hard to find. 
 
There are no native Samoan animals that are specialized for 
eating leaves (except insects and snails).  However, leaves are 
regular parts of the diet of fruit bats (pe'a) and Pacific Pigeon 
(lupe). Perhaps the leaves contain a nutrient that can't be found 
in fruit, or maybe they help to fill up a hungry animal when 
there is little other food available. 
 
Nectar is a very important food for many of our local animals.  
The beautiful red and black Cardinal Honeyeater (segasegamau'u) is our most specialized nectar-eater.  
Its long bill and tongue enable it to reach deep into flowers, and its small size allows it to perch on even 
the tiniest twigs to reach the blossoms.  Other birds that eat lots of nectar are the Wattled Honeyeater

(iao), and the pretty little parrot (segavao) found in Manu'a.  It may come as a surprise that fruit bats 
also eat a lot of nectar.  Bats eat flowers from many different kinds of plants, from those with large 
flowers (such as gatae and futu), medium sized flowers (such as fa'i), to those with large numbers of 
smaller flowers (such as asi, maota, and a'amati'e).  The bats lick flowers using their long tongues, or 
sometimes take a shortcut and eat the entire flower. 
 
Fruit is the most common item in the diet of the 
Samoan Starling (fuia), Pacific Pigeon (lupe), Purple-
capped Fruit Dove (manutagi), and fruit bats (pe'a).  
Though all these animals share many of the same 
foods, each has its favorites.  Differences in what each 
species eats are partly caused by the different ways 
they feed and by their different sizes.  Since lupe and 
manutagi swallow fruits whole, this limits the size of 
fruit they can eat.  Manutagi seem to eat no fruits 
larger than moso'oi, but lupe are not as limited because 
they have really big mouths and can eat all but the 
largest fruits.  Although fuia are smaller than lupe, 
they have stronger bills. This allows them to pry open 
tough husks, and to poke into very large fruits like esi.  
Pe'a can eat the largest and hardest fruits because of 
their strong jaws and sharp teeth.  They have a very unique way of feeding:  they take a bite from a fruit, 
but don't really swallow it.  Instead, each bite is squeezed in the mouth, the pe'a swallows the juice and 
pulp, then flicks its head and spits out a flattened mass of leftover fruit called an 'ejecta'. 
 
The white-naped fruit bats (pe'a fanua) seem to especially like fruits from plantations such as mangos, 
and those from coastal trees such as fetau, although maybe they really like flowers best.  Samoan fruit 
bats (pe'a vao) generally prefer fruits found in the forest, both from non-native trees like ifi and native 
species such as a'amati'e, asi and gasu.  Both bats like figs, especially the green-fruited kind of aoa, and 
perhaps most of all, ulu (breadfruit).  But if you see bats in your ulu, you needn't worry that they are 
taking food from your mouth -- they like the overripe fruit that has been left on the tree so long that 
people wouldn't eat it anyway. 
 
Our most common Columbiformes (lupe and manutagi) all love the fruit of moso'oi.  It's funny to watch 
a little manutagi struggling to choke down a big moso'oi fruit -- but they get it down every time.  
Another large fruit favored by lupe (and sometimes eaten by manutagi) is the nutmeg (atone).  This is 
an interesting 'fruit', since what the birds eat is almost entirely 
indigestible seed -- the useful part is just a thin, brightly colored 
network (red or orange depending on the species of atone) that 
covers the seed.  This colored part is very fatty and is a good food 
for birds even if there is not much on each fruit.  Apparently this is a 
successful way to disperse seeds, since atone is the most common 
tree in the mature forests of Tutuila.  
 
Fruits preferred by manutagi include aoa, mati, the white berries of 
soga, and the seeds inside maota and mamala fruits.  Lupe eat many 
of the same fruits, but are able to eat a greater variety because they 
are a big bird.  They also eat the large fruits of mamalava, 
mamalupe, a'amati'e and ala'a.  Mamalupe literally means 'pigeon's 
mouthful':  one lupe once took a full 30 seconds to swallow a single 
mamalupe fruit!

Nectar feeders and fruit eaters don't just use their food plants -- they can help them as well by fertilizing 
their flowers.  This happens when pollen from one flower sticks to a bird's feathers or the fur of a pe'a, 
and then rubs off when the animal visits another flower.  Fruit eaters also help plants.  Most of the time 
this happens when they eat the fruit but don't completely digest the seeds; when the animal defecates, 
the seeds may have been moved far from the parent tree where they have a better chance to grow.  Many 
plants actually count on animals eating their fruits, and so they coat their seeds with a substance that 
makes them hard to digest.  In this way, immobile trees accomplish their most difficult task -- dispersing 
(spreading) their seeds.  When a tree species has no seed dispersers, its spread to new areas will be 
limited, it can become restricted to only a few places, and it is vulnerable to extinction from cyclones, 
diseases, or cutting by people.  A good example of such a tree is ifilele, which tends to occur in only a 
few areas on the north side of Tutuila.  
 
Probably the most important disperser of fruits in American Samoa 
is the fuia, since it eats a very wide variety of fruits.  It is 
particularly important in regenerating (converting back to forest) 
areas that have been cleared for plantations or by cyclones.  You can 
see this by noting how quickly a cleared area will become covered 
with lau pata, maota, and masame, or how nonu or pualulu begin 
sprouting in a clearing deep in the forest.  Once an area has these 
initial forest tree species, the area becomes more suitable for tree 
species that prefer mature forests, like mamalava or asi. 
 
You can play an important role in helping the wildlife on our islands 
by helping our native trees.  First, avoid cutting down or burning 
native trees, especially slower growing species such as au'auli or 
important coastal species such as fetau.  Other trees are so rare or important that they simply should 
never be cut, including aoa, tava, and togo.  Some plantations illustrate a good compromise between the 
needs of people and the needs of the forest.  As the plantation is cleared, smaller, fast growing trees like 
lau pata or atone are cut, but larger trees are avoided, or only their limbs are pruned (cut off).  In this 
way crops like talo (taro) get the sunlight they need, but it does not kill large trees that are adapted to 
recovering from cyclone damage.  Such trees may resprout leaves and branches, probably about the time 
a farmer is done harvesting the crops from the plantation. 
 
Second, help native trees by planting them.  You can request seedlings of native species from the Land 
Grant at the Community College.  Always plant native trees instead of exotic (foreign) trees unless 
needed for their fruit.  For example, aoa should be planted instead of pulu trees.  Flame trees, vaepovi 
and African tulip trees may look attractive to people, but these trees benefit fewer wildlife species than 
our own native trees.  For areas such as lawns where large trees are not wanted, tree ferns (olioli) are an 
attractive native option, while the various kinds of mati are good choices for wildlife.  In places where 
too much shade is undesirable, filimoto is a good choice.

25.  Island streams  
 
 
Tutuila Island has about 141 small streams that flow year-round along at least a portion of their main 
channel.  These streams are steep, shallow and short (most are less than a mile long).  Stream flows are 
generally low but they can flood quickly in response to heavy downpours.  But even with the high 
rainfall in our mountains (200-300 inches per year), the water drains quickly to sea or percolates into 
the porous volcanic soil to recharge our groundwater supply of drinking water. 
 
Our streams support surprisingly few species -- there are only about 8-12 
freshwater fish species, and not many more freshwater invertebrates.  The 
principal species are freshwater eels (tuna), gobies (apofu, mano'o), mountain 
bass (sesele, inato), shrimp (ulavai) and snails (sisivai).  Additional species may 
enter the lower ends of streams, but they are not restricted to a freshwater stream 
environment.  Three non-native fish species were also introduced here, probably 
in the 1970s:  mollies (fo-vai; Poecilia mexicana) and mosquitofish (Gambusia 
affinis) to control mosquitoes, and tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) to grow 
in aquaculture.  The impact of these alien species on the native populations is 
not known.  Additionally, we can only wonder about the impact of the alien 
marine toad (lage) that sometimes has thousands of its young tadpoles swimming in local creeks. 
 
The low number of species in our streams is in stark contrast to the many marine species living in our 
coastal marine waters (890 fish species and countless invertebrates).  Part of the explanation for this 
difference is simply that our streams are small and offer limited habitat for stream-dwelling organisms.  
But another more interesting aspect of this low diversity is:  how did any freshwater species get to 
American Samoa in the first place?  We are a small island surrounded by hundreds of miles of deep 
ocean.  Freshwater species generally cannot survive in saltwater, so how could these freshwater fish, 
shrimps and snails cross the ocean barrier to get here?   
 
The trick is that they all have a marine stage in their life cycle.  After they spawn, their newly hatched 
larvae wash out of the stream into the ocean where they drift about as marine plankton for a few weeks 
or months.  Some make their way back to a coastline where they seek a stream to live out the rest of 
their lives.  It might be expected that the few freshwater species that got to our remote islands have 
evolved over thousands of years into unique (endemic) species found nowhere else in the world, but the 
opposite is generally true.  The marine stage of these species allows a wide dispersal and continual 
genetic mixing of populations, so most of the species inhabiting our streams are widely distributed 
across the South Pacific. 
 
Because streams drain the valleys we live in, they serve as good indicators of how well we are taking 
care of the land.  Sad to say the message is not good.  Our streams once provided food and drinking 
water, but now they are treated as a place for people to throw rubbish and piggery wastes.  There have 
even been deaths in American Samoa due to leptospirosis, a bacteria from piggeries and other animals 
that pollutes many streams.  And, after a heavy rainfall, some streams turn chocolate brown with the dirt 
that erodes from the landscape.  Much of this soil erosion is due to poor land-use practices such as the 
farmer's bare-earth clearings for plantations on steep mountain slopes and the run-off from inadequately 
designed construction sites.  In the former case, the farmer not only loses the soil needed to grow his 
crops, but the eroded dirt fouls our streams and ends up in coastal waters where it harms our coral reefs.  
It does not have to be this way.  There are better ways to dispose of rubbish and to prevent erosion that 
can make streams a healthier place for fish as well as for the children who play in the streams.

26.  Life in a Samoan stream:  fish, snails & shrimp 
 
 
Streams are the plumbing of our islands.  They rely solely on rain, which seeps from steep rainforest-
clad hills and trickles through the porous volcanic soil carrying with it the products of the land.  Small 
streams join with others to create a mosaic of channels across the islands.  Waterfalls, cascades, pools 
and riffles make each stream unique and influence the kinds of animals found there.   
 
Our freshwater stream animals play an important role in maintaining a healthy stream ecosystem.  These 
species might be overlooked because they are shy and rather blandly colored, which might lead to the 
assumption that they are not there at all, but that of course is not true.  The best way to observe them is 
to find a spot on a rock and quietly watch until they emerge from their hiding places.  Keep in mind that 
from the animal’s point of view there is a lot going on.  Animals are constantly interacting with each 
other as well as with their environment.  The presence of a predator, for example, will have a huge 
influence on the behavior of its prey.  It is a constant game of cat and mouse, eat or be eaten.  Habitat 
type, or where an animal likes to live, is also very important.  Certain species prefer pools, others like 
shallow riffles, and for most species, waterfalls are barriers to their upstream movements although a few 
hardy species can climb up them. 
 
Fish.  Predatory fishes, like the freshwater eel 
(Angulia spp.), mountain bass (Kulia spp.), and 
dusky sleeper (Eleotris fusca) tend to dominate the 
lower reaches of a stream and feed on smaller fish 
and shrimp.  They are only average climbers and 
cannot make it up the steep slopes of a waterfall.  
Instead they rely mainly on their powerful swimming 
and gliding ability to move through small rapids and 
over large boulders and rocks.  Look for eels in 
crevices and holes.  Mountain bass are often seen in 
pools not far from the ocean.  Their silvery sides and flag-like tails make them easy to spot.  The dusky 
sleeper uses stealth and surprise to catch its prey.  It props itself on rocks using its fins and turns darker 
for camouflage when ambushing prey.  For this reason this species is not an easy one to spot.  
 
Herbivorous fishes, like the small gobies (Stiphodon spp. and Sicyopterus spp.), are usually present in 
large numbers.  They may be seen in quiet riffles and pools grazing on long green algal strands or the 
slippery brown algae coating the rocks.  An 
interesting feature of the goby is that its pelvic fins 
form a suction cup that enables the goby to cling to 
rocks and climb waterfalls.  One goby (Stiphodon 
hydoreibatus) is endemic to Samoa and found 
nowhere else in the world. 
 
Snails.  Stream snails, which all belong to the family Neritidae, are herbivores that graze on the algae 
growing on stream rocks.  About a dozen species are known locally.  Two distinct types of neritid snails 
are present.  One is the rounded black/brown shell of the Neritina or Clithon species.  The shell of these 
has little or no spire and an interesting device called an “operculum” that acts like a trap door.  This 
allows the snail to retract into its shell and literally close the door -- a great mechanism to have when 
you do not want to be eaten.

Neritina variegata 
Clithon corona 
Septaria sanguisuga 
 
The other type of shell is the cap-like Septaria species.  It has no visible operculum and therefore the 
snail cannot retract into its shell.  Instead it clamps to rocks with its muscular foot, making it very hard 
to detach.  This is useful when you live in turbulent rapids or on steep walls.  Besides these two 
differences, you may also notice variations in shell color, pattern and texture.  They range from light to 
very dark brown with zigzag, wavy, or straight lines, or none at all.  They may be smooth and shiny or 
grooved and wrinkled.  Some even have horns. 
 
A small turret shaped snail (Melanoides sp.) can also be found near the edge of streams in gravel and 
mud.  This species is found throughout the Pacific.  
 
Shrimp.  Probably the most versatile freshwater species are 
the shrimp.  American Samoa is home to two families, 
Atyidae and Palaemonidae, each with 4-5 species.  The 
palaemonid Macrobrachium shrimp are possibly the most 
well known and can be easily seen in the lower to middle 
reaches of our streams.  They are easy to identify by their 
large pincers.  When wading through pools and shallow runs, 
watch for these shrimp as they make a quick retreat at your 
approach.  Although shy, they will reappear if you keep still.  
These scavengers feed on both plant and animal material.  
They may also dislodge Neritina and Corona snails from 
rocks, open them up and devour them. 
 
Atyidae shrimp can be found throughout many clean streams.  
Some are excellent climbers and congregate in the lee of 
rocks and boulders of fast flowing streams.  Others seek a 
quiet place in the vegetation and roots of plants near a stream 
edge where flow is slow.  These shrimp exhibit distinct 
feeding behaviors.  In fast flowing water they orient 
themselves in the direction of the current and spread the fine 
brushes on their front legs to form upturned umbrellas. They 
use these to filter food particles carried in the current and 
then push them into their mouth.  In slower moving water 
they use their brushes to pluck food items from plants and gravel. 
 
Stream insects.  Although some insects are common inhabitants in streams around the world, they are 
not well-represented on our small oceanic islands.  Few of the terrestrial insects we see in American 
Samoa have an aquatic stage in their life cycle (some exceptions being a few dragonflies, damselflies, 
midges, mayflies, and beetles).

27.  Snakes In Samoa ! 
 
 
Snakes in Samoa?  You bet.  Two kinds, one right here on Tutuila Island and the other on Ta'u Island.  
Fortunately, neither is the dreaded brown tree snake (more about that below).  Also fortunately, neither 
is poisonous, both mind their own business, and they are no threat to anyone. 
 
On Tutuila, we have an unusually small black snake that looks like an 
odd earthworm about 6 inches long.  A closer inspection reveals that 
it has tiny scales.  It's called the potted soil snake or blind burrowing 
snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus), because it has almost no eyes and 
it burrows through the soil.  This secretive nocturnal snake is 
occasionally found by someone digging in their garden.  It eats small 
soil creatures like termites and insect larvae. 
 
This harmless snake is widely distributed around the world, but it is not native to our islands.  It was 
probably introduced here when its eggs were carried in the soil attached to some imported plants or 
machinery.  In 1993, it was found in the Tafuna area.  Others were found in the Pago Pago area in 2001.     
 
The other snake found infrequently on Ta'u Island is the gata or Pacific boa (Candoia bibroni).  It also 
occurs in western Samoa.  At one time it inhabited Tutuila Island (its bones were found there) but it 
went extinct for unknown reasons.  On Ofu, an older resident remembers seeing one there when he was 
a child. 
 
The Pacific boa is more commonly found on islands closer to Indonesia; American Samoa appears to be 
the eastward limit of its distribution.  It can grow to a respectable length of 3 to 6 feet and is tan or 
darkly colored, but its coloration can be variable.  This species is usually found in forests, it is active 
mainly at night, and it probably eats lizards, rats, and small birds and bird eggs. 
 
The Pacific boa looks a lot like another undesirable snake species, the brown tree snake (Boiga 
irregularis), which we don't have in Samoa and hopefully never will.  You may have heard that the 
brown tree snake invaded Guam and caused 
havoc there.  It wiped out Guam's native 
bird species and helped decimate their fruit 
bat populations by eating the young bats 
left hanging in the trees when the adults 
flew off to find food.   
 
Parents in Guam were even advised to keep 
their infants and small children away from 
this snake because it is somewhat 
poisonous and occasionally has been caught 
lunching on a baby's arm.  How's that for a 
reptilian nightmare? 
 
Well, not to fear.  We do not have the brown tree snake in Samoa.  So, if you see a large snake on Ta'u 
island, don't kill it.  However, if you see one on Tutuila Island, it is very important that you send it to 
DMWR for identification.  It is essential that we keep the brown tree snake out of American Samoa.  
Several of them have already slipped into Hawaii hidden in air cargo shipments from Guam.  The 
snakes will crawl into the cargo or onto the plane's landing gear and then go wherever the plane goes.

A final note.  On rare occasions, sea snakes have been seen in our coastal waters.  One verified air-
breathing banded sea snake (probably Laticauda columbrina) was collected here in 2000.  However, 
most local sightings of “sea snakes” are actually fish (eels) that are very snake-like in appearance.  It 
would not be difficult to confuse the two:

28.  Toads everywhere 
 
 
The marine or cane toad (Bufo marinus) is a relatively recent 
introduction to American Samoa.  It was purposely brought here 
from Hawaii in 1954 to control mosquitoes or insect pests that 
attack taro.  Toads (lage) were introduced into artificial ponds at 
Taputimu on Tutuila, and from there, stocks were liberated in 
Tafuna and Utulei.  The toads then expanded their range to 
include all of Tutuila, from sea level to the top of Mt. Alava.  
Fortunately, they have not yet been transported to Manu'a or to 
western Samoa. 
 
The toads breed year-round here.  All they need is standing fresh or slightly brackish water in which to 
lay their eggs.  Thousands of eggs that look like a string of black and white pearls are laid by each 
female.  Within a week the eggs hatch into small black tadpoles that feed voraciously on aquatic plants.  
The tadpoles look defenseless but are thought to be toxic to birds and other animals.  Within a month 
these tadpoles develop legs and change into adult toads.  
 
 
 
As adults, they typically hide under boards or vegetation during the heat of the day and emerge at night 
to feed on insects and other invertebrates.  They eat snails, millipedes, centipedes, spiders, roaches, 
moths, flies, caterpillars, termites, beetles, ants, earthworms, grasses, and even an occasional small toad. 
   
How many toads inhabit Tutuila Island and how many bugs do they consume each night?  In a wildlife 
study conducted in 1976, biologists estimated that over 2 million toads lived here with us.  Some rough 
calculations suggest that these toads consume about 5 tons of bugs every night! 
 
To some people it might appear that the toad is beneficial.  One must keep in mind, however, that many 
of those insects would have been eaten by native birds and perhaps by the small insect-eating sheath-
tailed bat (pe'ape'avai) that is now extremely rare in American Samoa.  No one has examined the actual 
impacts the toads are having on our native wildlife, but there are many examples of introduced species 
causing the extinction of native plants and animals by out-competing them for food or other resources. 
 
Another concern involving the toad is its toxic skin glands.  The adults have two large parotid glands on 
their “shoulders” that secrete a creamy white fluid when handled.  These secretions are highly toxic if 
eaten, rubbed into the eyes, or brought into contact with mucous membranes.  Dogs have died when 
they mouthed these toads.  In addition, a high incidence of the salmonella bacteria occurs in toads, thus 
an abundance of toads near drinking water supplies may lead to bacterial contamination.

29.  Disappearing land snails 
 
 
Snails belong to the second largest group of animals on 
earth, the mollusks.  Only the arthropods (insects, 
crustaceans and their relatives) have more known species.  
Snails are found just about everywhere – the ocean, streams, 
lakes, and on land.  Over 90 native species of land snails 
occur in the Samoan Archipelago.  Of these, 64 occur in 
western Samoa and 47 in American Samoa (many are found 
in both places).  Slugs, which are snail-like mollusks that 
have no shell, also occur locally, but none is a native species 
-- all are recent introductions to our islands. 
 
Many of our native land snails are found only on our islands – that is, they 
are endemic to the Samoan Archipelago.  Some of them even occur only 
on a single island, so they are endemic to that island.  Their shells come in 
all shapes and sizes – flat, tall, rounded or spiraled.  Some live in trees, 
where they may eat dying leaves. Others live on the ground and probably 
feed on dead leaves.  Together with fungi and other microorganisms that 
help to decompose the leaf debris, snails contribute to the cycling of 
nutrients through the ecosystem. 
 
We do not know much about the basic biology of these land snails.  Some species have separate males 
and females, but others are hermaphrodites, where each snail is both male and female.  However, most 
hermaphroditic snails still reproduce by mating with another individual – each snail can act 
simultaneously as a male and as a female, or in some species the snails take turns being males and 
females.  Most snails lay eggs, but some give birth to live young – miniature snails that simply crawl 
away.  The snails that produce live young tend to grow and reproduce very slowly – some of the tree 
snails may take over a year to reach full size and may live as long as 5-10 years, producing only 10-20 
young per year.  This contrasts with egg-laying species that probably grow much quicker, produce many 
eggs, but do not live as long. 
 
There are three possible ways that land snails could have crossed the 
ocean to get to our remote islands.  First, they might have been 
carried over the ocean from a distant continent – or from another 
island – on rafts of driftwood or fallen logs.  But salt kills land 
snails, so this seems unlikely.  Perhaps they were carried here by 
birds.  Sometimes snails get caught up in the feathers of birds, 
especially if they are really small snails.  And third, they might have 
been blown by the wind.  Scientists have found that very small 
snails can indeed be blown long distances by strong winds. A small snail attached to a leaf, caught up in 
a cyclone, could be blown hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles across the ocean.  Through 
evolutionary time (millions of years), these seemingly unlikely events had only to happen very 
occasionally in order for a few land snails to eventually colonize our islands. 
 
Once the land snails arrived and managed to survive, they began to evolve to local conditions.  Some 
species changed and became so different from their ancestors that scientists now identify them as 
different species.  Others evolved into more than one species.  This is how the Samoan islands came to 
have many land snail species found nowhere else on earth – they evolved after they arrived here.

Many of the local snail species have attractively colored shells and have often been used in the making 
of ula or leis and for other ornamental purposes.  For instance, the hanging light fixtures in the old lobby 
of the Rainmaker Hotel in Pago Pago contained 10,000 or more shells of tree snails that used to be 
abundant in the forests of Tutuila. 
 
But now many of our local snail species are disappearing. At least seven species have become extremely 
rare and one of them, Diastole matafaoi from Tutuila, is now extinct.  Others are undoubtedly in trouble 
but have simply not been fully evaluated yet.  The two main reasons for their decline are the same 
reasons that biodiversity is vanishing all over the world.  First is habitat destruction or modification.  As 
native forest is cut down for timber or cleared for agriculture or urban development, the habitat of those 
snail species that depend on the forest disappears and so the snails disappear too.  Second is the 
introduction to the islands of alien species – species that have been brought to the islands by humans, 
either on purpose or accidentally.  These aliens include pigs that destroy the forest by rooting for food 
and creating wallows, plants that grow and reproduce more strongly than the native species and replace 
them in the forest, birds that spread alien plants by carrying their seeds into native forest, rats and ants 
that prey on snails, and many other species that people have introduced to the islands. 
 
These alien species also include snails and slugs that come 
from elsewhere in the world.  Most people are likely to see 
only these aliens unless they hike into the most pristine 
native forest.  Perhaps the most commonly seen are the giant 
African snail (sisi aferika, Achatina fulica) and the large 
black or brown slugs.  But there are many other species that 
are not so obvious but that can be found easily just by turning 
over some leaves on the ground almost anywhere in the 
islands.  The giant African snail is a pest of agriculture and in 
gardens but some of these other less well-known species may also be causing problems for the native 
snail species.  Two of them (Subulina octona and Paropeas achatinaceum) are now the most abundant 
snails in the leaf debris of native forest throughout the islands. It is quite possible that they are 
impacting native snails by out-competing them for the resources they depend upon. 
 
Another alien snail, the predatory snail known as the 
‘cannibal snail’ or ‘rosy wolf snail’ (Euglandina rosea) was 
introduced in an ill-conceived attempt to control the giant 
African snail by eating it.  It was introduced even though 
there is no scientific evidence that it would reduce 
populations of the African snail.  The problem is that it 
attacks native snail species that had evolved in the absence of 
such aggressive predators.  Some of our local species 
reproduce at a very slow rate and this means that their 
populations are highly vulnerable to sustained predation.  Euglandina rosea is thought to have been 
introduced only to Tutuila and Ta’u.  In western Samoa it was introduced to Upolu in the 1990s. 
 
An even more voracious predator of snails, the flatworm Platydemus manokwari, was 
unfortunately introduced to Upolu in 2003 to control the African snail.  This free-
living flatworm appears to be common on Tutuila Island as well.  It is black or dark 
brown, with a single line down its back, and it can grow to almost 3 inches long and 
1/4 inch wide.  This flatworm is believed to have decimated snail populations on other 
Pacific islands.

30. Four interesting insects:  afato, se, alisi, lelefue 
 
 
Insects are an impressive group.  They are extremely abundant and highly diverse (over 800,000 species 
worldwide), they inhabit almost every terrestrial and aquatic habitat imaginable, and they have been on 
earth long before the dinosaurs ever roamed.  Over 2,500 species have been recorded in the Samoan 
Archipelago, with many more yet to be documented.  Four large but somewhat secretive insects are 
featured here: 
Giant longhorn beetle.  These beetles are unusual for two 
reasons:  they grow very large and people eat them.  The adult 
beetle pictured here was almost 3 inches long from head to tail.  
What does it eat with those large powerful jaws?  It lays its eggs 
in standing dead trees (particularly mamalava, tufaso, tavai) and 
after hatching, the larvae feed on the surrounding wood.  These 
larvae (afato) grow very large and are collected and eaten in 
Samoa, Fiji and probably throughout the South Pacific.  Two 
villages in Savai’i are particularly well known for harvesting 
many afato:  Gataivai and Aopo.  Afato are fed coconut 
shavings, and then they are often eaten with coconut cream, and 
they taste like …. coconut.  But here in American Samoa, times 
are changing – one person said he had eaten afato in the past 
                                                                but now he prefers to eat a Big Mac.  
 
Walking stick (se).  These large green or brown insects 
can grow up to 5 inches long.  They usually remain 
motionless and look like a branch or small twig, hoping 
that this camouflage will spare them from being eaten by 
a hungry Samoan starling (fuia).  These slow-moving 
‘sticks’ feed on leaves, most notably coconut fronds.  
Some can fly, although not very gracefully -- if one lands 
on a person, a local belief is that it is a messenger announcing that someone will be coming to visit you. 
 
Katydid (alisi).  Here’s the insect that makes all that noise at dusk.  As the sun 
sets, katydids start the evening with a loud screechy chorus that lasts about 20 
minutes.  After a little warm-up noise, they synchronize with their neighbors so 
that all of them are screech screeching in unison.  These are male katydids 
trying to attract females.  The sound is produced as they rub special structures 
on their front wings, back and forth.  Katydids are green, about 1.5 inches long, 
and look like a leaf.  Just like the walking sticks, katydids hope their 
camouflage make them difficult to see.  Katydids are related to crickets and 
grasshoppers and are sometimes called long-horned grasshoppers. 
 
Hummingbird moth (lelefua).  At dusk you might be surprised to see 
what looks like a hummingbird hovering in front of a flower, 
sipping its nectar.  This is actually a thick-bodied moth with an 
extremely rapid wing beat and a long proboscis that it sticks down 
the flower tubes.  This is a good example of convergent evolution, 
where two very different kinds of organisms (a bird and a moth) 
evolved a similar way to extract nectar out of long, delicate flowers.  
The moth is also known as the hawk or sphinx moth.

31. The bugs in your house 
 
 
There will always be some bugs in your house, so relax a little and get used to them.  Before you know 
it, you will be sweeping termite droppings off your kitchen counter as if you didn’t have a care in the 
world.  Several common household insects (beetles, moths, termites, cockroaches, wasps, ants) and 
other arthropods (centipedes, millipedes, spiders) are described below. 
 
Centipede (atualoa).  The large, 6-inch brown centipede (Scolopendra 
subspinipes) is well known locally but not commonly seen.  It is quite fast 
and scary looking as it searches for things to eat at night.  Occasionally 
someone gets bitten and it can be extremely painful.  The local Emergency 
Medical Services responds to a few calls each month, particularly after a 
lot of rainfall has driven the atualoa to higher grounds.  People vary in 
their response to a bite, but for most, there is not much that can be done 
about it, and the pain will usually lessen in a few hours. 
 
Millipedes (anufesaina).  Millipedes are neither insects nor worms but a different 
kind of arthropod.  They differ from centipedes in being slower, rounder and in 
having two pairs of little legs per body segment.  Our local millipedes grow up to 
about two inches long.  They are active at night and feed primarily on rotting 
wood and leaves.  They are generally harmless and curl up when threatened.  
However, anufesaina have defensive glands along the sides of their body that 
can produce foul and sometimes poisonous secretions, and they can cause a 
burn-like pain on your skin if you squash one.  
 
Cockroaches (moga moga).  At least give cockroaches some credit for 
inhabiting earth millions of years before we humans ever showed up.  
Nonetheless, it is their fate to be despised insects associated with filth.  
They are extremely hardy scavengers that will eat almost anything.  One 
species living here is the large non-native American cockroach, 
Periplaneta americana.  Their egg cases look like brown beans, each 
containing 10-20 eggs that hatch in 5-7 weeks.  Their total life span is 
probably 2 years or so.  Cockroaches are nocturnal, so if they are also seen 
during daytime, the house is probably heavily infested. 
 
Ensign wasps.  A wasp yes, but a good one, so don’t swat it.  You’ll occasionally 
see these spider-like black insects flying around the house.  They look like they 
were built out of parts that don’t quite match up.  There’s a large head, and a boxy 
middle part (thorax), followed by a tiny posterior (abdomen) hanging off the back 
that bobs up and down like a flag being waved (the “ensign”).  These wasps don’t 
sting people.  Instead they use their “stinger” to lay their eggs inside cockroach 
egg cases.  Before the young cockroaches can emerge from the case, the wasp eggs hatch first and eat 
all the cockroach eggs.  All in all, these little “black flag” wasps probably kill a lot more cockroaches 
than we ever could with our spray-can insecticides. 
 
Termites.  There are usually two times when we notice termites in the house.  The 
first is when a large swarm of them suddenly appears fluttering around a light bulb 
in the evening.  These are male and female termites in love.  What identifies them as 
termites is their large, equal-size pair of wings, and that they shed their wings after 
their nuptial flight.  The second time we notice them is when we see the daily piles

of their droppings on the kitchen counter or floor.  At one point, their droppings in my house were so 
numerous, I collected them in plastic bags, with the idea that maybe I could market them as “South 
Pacific pollen” to some health food store in California. 
 
Ambrosia beetles.  These irritating little beetles appear in the early evening, fly 
towards the light, and crawl around on you like fleas in your hair.  If you don’t 
know what I’m talking about, you are one of the privileged people whom these 
beetles do not bother.  These wood-boring insects (Xyleborus sp.) are dark brown 
and 2.5 mm long.  They are called ambrosia beetles because they carry a fungus 
(the “ambrosia”) that they use to inoculate the tunnels that they drill into a tree. 
The fungus grows in the tunnels and provides food for their larvae. After mating, 
the female beetles emerge and go in search of another tree to lay their eggs in.  
 
 
Casebearer moth.  At some point you may notice these odd little insects dragging 
around their flat diamond-shaped cases.  These are the larvae of the small casebearer 
moth (Phereoeca sp.).  The larva is visible when it extends out of the case, but it 
retreats into the case when threatened or turns around and pops out the other end.  
They plod on, as if they really had someplace to go.  The larger cases are about 1-cm 
in length and are made out of silk fibers encrusted with debris such as sand particles, 
hair and insect parts.  The larva lives and grows in the case for about 2 months, feeding on things like 
old spider webs, wool fibers, etc.  After pupating, the larva develops into a tiny gray moth that measures 
about 5 mm from head to tip of wings.  A female moth lives only a week and lays about 200 eggs. 
 
Spiders (apogaleveleve).  We have a variety of web-spinning spiders in the 
house, as well as hunting spiders that don't make webs but actively search 
for their prey.  Some are quite big and may give you a fright, but none are 
known to cause us problems.  Hunting spiders include jumping spiders 
(which hunt in the daytime and are common in houses), wolf spiders (not 
often seen in houses), and large huntsman spiders that are big enough to 
prey on large cockroaches. 
 
Ants (loi).  Ants occur everywhere in American Samoa. You may not notice them 
very much until you leave some leftover sweets or other food lying around and come 
back later to find it crawling with ants transporting it piece by piece or drop by drop 
back to their nest.  One common species is the crazy ant, Paratrechina longicornis.  
They are black, about three millimeters long, and have long legs and antennae.  They 
seem to be running all the time, and it’s amazing how fast they can appear by the 
dozens around some spilled soda or juice.  When disturbed they run even faster, 
circling and zigzagging all over -- as if they really are crazy. 
 
Bug eaters: geckos (mo’o).   From the abundance of gecko 
droppings around the house, it’s apparent that the geckos 
hanging on the walls are eating lots of bugs.  Think of these 
droppings as little blessings in disguise.

32. Mosquitoes, Filariasis & Dengue Fever 
 
 
Mosquitoes may play a role in the grand scheme of things, but I’m not really 
keen on the idea that they want to suck my blood.  Worse still, they can 
infect us with two diseases in American Samoa -- more about that shortly. 
 
At least 12 species of mosquitoes (namu) occur in American Samoa.  Most 
are common across the western South Pacific region, but some are endemic 
to the Samoan islands (Aedes upolensis, Coquillettidia samoaensis, 
Ochlerotatus samoanus, Oc. tutuilae) and a few are newly introduced. 
 
Their life cycle involves several stages, one is the irritating adult mosquito, 
but their juveniles live in water.  To reproduce, the adult female needs to 
obtain a blood meal (from you) to develop her eggs.  She then lays her eggs 
in quiet puddles of water where they hatch and grow.  The larvae breath air, 
so they generally hang around at the water surface but will wiggle quite 
actively when disturbed.  After a week or two, the larvae pupate (a resting 
stage) and then emerge as flying adults.  Females may live for 2-3 weeks and 
lay several clutches of eggs (each requires a blood meal).  Only the female 
mosquito searches for a blood meal; the males (the ones with fuzzy 
antennae) feed on plant nectar.  Also, not all the mosquitoes are after you 
personally -- some species seek out birds as their preferred blood meal. 
 
The female mosquito finds you by following signals given off by your body such as body heat, odors 
and carbon dioxide.  Light and movement also help her zero-in on you.  She then sinks her long and thin 
mouth parts into your skin and sucks out a drop of blood, engorging so much that she can barely fly 
away.  During the biting process, she secretes saliva into the cut to prevent the blood from coagulating.  
Your body’s reaction to this saliva is what causes the bite to itch and swell. 
 
Mosquitoes can carry two diseases in American Samoa: filariasis and dengue.  Both can cause serious 
problems.  These diseases are spread by specific mosquito species:  dengue (principally Aedes 
polynesiensis and Ae. aegypti) and filariasis (mainly Aedes polynesiensis, and Oc. samoanus). 
 
Filariasis, also known as elephantiasis (tutupa, mumu), is caused by parasitic nematode worms called 
filariae.  When an infected mosquito bites you, these minute worms crawl from the mosquito’s 
mouthparts onto your body and into the cut.  This is not a particularly efficient way to enter your body, 
so the number of them transmitted from a single mosquito bite is probably limited.  Multiple mosquito 
bites by infected A. polynesiensis may be needed before a person develops the full-blown disease.  The 
worms lodge in a person’s lymphatic system where they can live for 4-6 years and produce millions of 
minute larvae (microfilariae).  These larvae circulate in your blood and are sucked up by other 
mosquitoes that bite you and thus can be spread to other people.  In severe cases, filariasis can cause a 
very large swelling of arms, legs or genitals.   
 
The number of people infected in American Samoa is considerable.  In two surveys, people in several 
villages here were examined for filariasis and 17% (in 1999) and 13% (in 2002) were found to be  
currently or recently infected.  But not all these people have swollen limbs.  In general, about half of the 
people who are infected show no symptoms of the disease, but they may develop them as they get older.  
Our local Public Health Department together with the Center for Disease Control has joined a 
worldwide program to reduce filariasis by giving every person on island a medication that kills the

NATURAL HISTORY GUIDE
 
 
62
microfilariae circulating in your blood, thus preventing their further spread by mosquitoes.  The cycle of 
infection can be broken if the number of people carrying this disease is significantly reduced. 
 
Dengue fever is also transmitted by mosquitoes.  Dengue is a viral disease that is rapidly expanding in 
tropical and subtropical areas of the world.  It’s not native to American Samoa but is periodically 
brought here by travelers from other infected areas.  It then gets spread around primarily by the daytime-
biting Aedes polynesiensis and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes.  This virus is present in the mosquito’s saliva, so 
it is injected directly into you when an infected mosquito bites you.  Symptoms range from mild fevers 
to severe and potentially life-threatening illness.  No vaccine is available yet. 
 
A key point to emphasize here is that filariasis and dengue cannot be spread 
directly from person to person.  An intermediate host, the mosquito, is 
required to transmit the disease. 
 
Three other mosquito-borne diseases are worth mentioning.  The most serious 
one, malaria, does not occur in American Samoa.  It is found in the western 
region of the South Pacific, but the particular species of mosquito that 
transmits malaria (the Anopheles mosquito) does not occur this far east.  A 
different type of malaria does occur here, but it infects only birds (avian malaria).  The birds don’t seem 
to be greatly affected by it however, perhaps because they’ve adapted to it over a long period of time.  
Similarly, there is a mosquito-borne parasitic nematode on island that affects dogs (heartworm). 
 
Will tourists to American Samoa pick up these diseases?  Not too likely.  First, dengue is usually not 
present here, only when an infected traveler brings the disease here.  Second, filariasis probably requires 
multiple bites by specific mosquito species, and probably only a small percent of this species actually 
carries the disease at any given time. 
 
Scientists predict that we may see an increase in such diseases due to global warming and climate 
change.  Although exact mechanisms are not known, many pathogens are sensitive to temperature; for 
example, growth, reproduction, and biting rates of insects all increase with higher temperatures.  Global 
warming appears to be triggering a number of disease epidemics worldwide, involving a diversity of 
pathogens (viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites) and a wide range of hosts (humans, corals, oysters, 
terrestrial plants, birds).   
 
There are several basic measures that can be taken to reduce mosquito-borne diseases: 
 
1. Find their breeding sites.  Mosquitoes require water to complete their life cycle, so removing 
pockets of standing water around your house will help reduce their numbers.  Survey your yard and 
eliminate areas where water can collect, such as discarded tires, buckets, coconut shells, saimin bowls, 
aluminum cans, cemetery urns, clogged roof gutters, etc.  Drill holes in the bottom of large containers 
so that the water does not accumulate in them, or cover large objects like rain barrels with screening.  
2.  Avoid getting bitten.  When the mosquitoes are out, wear long-sleeved shirts and long-pants.  Use 
repellants and insecticides safely.  Repair window screens on your house, and if needed, sleep under 
mosquito net tents while resting during the day and night. 
3. Take filariasis medicine.  Remember, you can be infected with the filariasis worm and not have 
symptoms.  The filariasis medicine is free, so take it every year to break the cycle.  If the health 
workers miss coming to your house each year, go to the hospital and ask for the medicine. 
4. Be thankful for the swiftlets (pe’ape’a).  They eat mosquitoes (and other flying insects).

33.  Fungi:  the vital decomposers 
 
 
What do leaf spots, beer, itchy feet, rotting trees, fresh bread, 
mold, and pizza have in common?  Fungus!  Different kinds of 
fungi (the pleural of fungus is fungi) can cause diseases in plants 
and humans, make alcohol and raise bread.  Certain fungi 
(mushrooms) are cooked and eaten. 
 
Fungi are sometimes used by Samoans to make fermented drinks, 
such as pulouaitu (ghost hat).  This drink is made from 
mushrooms growing out of cattle dung that are boiled, strained, 
and drunk to cause an alcohol-like feeling.  Alafa is an interesting 
forest mushroom (Mycena sp.?) that glows in the dark and has 
actually been used to illuminate or mark trails at night.  Children 
also create a strange effect by sticking alafa on their faces.  
Several other unrelated organisms also produce this 
bioluminescence, or biological light, by metabolizing a chemical in their bodies called luciferin.  
Different organisms produce different colors of light: green for jellyfish, greenish-yellow for fireflies, 
red for railroad worms, and greenish-blue for glow worms and mushrooms.  Scientists continue to study 
this light-producing process, which is extremely efficient (almost 90%). 
 
People used to think fungi were a kind of plant and placed them in the plant kingdom.  But fungi are so 
different from any other organism, they were given their own kingdom.  Most fungi (except yeasts and a 
few others) are made up of many cells arranged in long strands called hyphae.  All the hyphae together 
make up the mycelium, or body of the fungus.  As the hyphae grow through their food, a plant for 
example, they release enzymes.  These enzymes dissolve the plant cell walls and the fungus mycelium 
absorbs the nutrients from the plant. 
 
 
We are usually aware of fungi only when they damage 
something.  That’s because they live inside the things they 
are eating.  Sometimes we see their white mycelium in rotted 
wood, but most often we don’t see them until they form 
"fruiting bodies".  These fruiting bodies make thousands and 
thousands of spores that grow into new fungi wherever they 
land.  Sometimes these spores are brightly colored, like the 
blue, green, or white mold on old food, or the black mold in 
the bathroom shower.  Other times we find mushrooms, 
another kind of fruiting body, growing on the ground or from 
trees.  Fruiting bodies are an indication that the insides of the 
trees are being eaten.  These fungi may be thin and delicate, 
tough and rubbery, or hard as wood.  The “ear fungus” 
(Auricularia) is brownish-purple, and thin like an ear, while 
the “tooth fungus” (Flavodon) is bright chartreuse with short 
tooth-like pores on which the spores are formed.   
 
Most wood decay fungi are called conks, or shelf fungi.  One 
of the most common “wood rotters” in American Samoa is 
the artist’s conk (Ganoderma australe).  This fungus grows 
out from the tree in the shaped of a fan.  It has a light brown 
top that is sometimes dusty with spores from the conks above

it, and a whitish-gray lower surface.  The gray surface looks smooth but is actually made up of 
thousands of very small pores, inside of which the spores are formed.  If this pore surface is lightly 
scratched, a brown line remains, and for centuries people have left messages or drawn pictures on them, 
hence their name, “artist’s conk”.   
 
Some fungi threaten our food supply.  The black leaf streak disease of bananas (lausu lui, or black 
Sigatoka) is caused by a fungus (Mycosphaerella fijiensis) that you can only see through a microscope.  
It damages the banana leaves, making the fruit small and of poor quality. Farmers have to use special 
chemicals to control this disease, which cost them time and money.  The taro leaf blight disease (lega) 
that killed most of the Samoan taro in 1993-1994 was caused by a water mold (Phytophthora 
colocasiae).  We used to call water molds ‘fungi’, but scientific tests show they are more closely related 
to certain red algae.  They have spores that swim and their mycelium is made of very different 
ingredients.  Water molds are no longer in the kingdom Fungi, but have been placed in one of the new 
kingdoms, either Protoctista or Chromista.

The colorful lichens that grow on trees and rocks are actually fungi and algae living together.  This type 
of relationship is called mutualism, where both organisms benefit from the relationship.  In severe 
climates, the fungus protects the alga from damaging ultraviolet light and supplies water and dissolved 
minerals. The alga makes food for both organisms 
through photosynthesis.  In other instances, this symbiosis 
could be considered parasitism.  In American Samoa, 
many algae living on leaves or tree bark receive enough 
moisture and shade to exist without the help of a fungus.  
In fact, the fungus may actually damage or kill the algae. 
 
Fungi fill a very important role in nature by breaking 
down dead organisms into their basic elements so those 
elements can be used again to build new organisms.  This 
nutrient recycling is especially important in the tropics 
where organisms are born and die at a very fast rate.  If it 
weren't for fungi, bacteria, and other small organisms that 
eat dead plants, dead trees and bushes would soon bury us. 
 
WARNING!  Many fungi are poisonous.  Eating them can cause sickness or even death.  Don’t eat any 
mushrooms unless you are certain they are safe.

34.  Pest invaders are here 
 
 
The history of life on islands is a 
story of invasions.  Ever since the 
high islands of American Samoa 
rose out of the sea as barren piles of 
volcanic rock, living things have 
been making the long and dangerous 
journey across the Pacific to reach 
this new land.  Until a few thousand 
years ago, every plant, insect, and 
bird that lived on our islands was the descendant of a lucky adventurer that had crossed hundreds or 
thousands of miles of open ocean to establish a new colony here.  
 
The first Samoans were also such lucky adventurers, making the perilous voyage here in their 
journeying canoes.  But their arrival marked the beginning of a new way for plants and animals to reach 
our islands -- being carried here, either by accident or on purpose, by people.  Ever since then, the 
environment of American Samoa has changed tremendously.   
 
Some of these changes may have benefited some wildlife species.  For example, the introduction several 
important food plants such as breadfruit and bananas provide a year-round source of food for some birds 
and fruit bats, rather than seasonally like some native plants that are eaten by wildlife.  Other changes 
brought by the Polynesians were harmful to the environment -- for example, the introduction of rats 
(isumu).  And since the arrival of Europeans and Americans, the rate of introduction of new plants and 
animals to American Samoa has increased tremendously.  The results have often been disastrous. 
 
Some plants brought by the Polynesians “escaped” to spread widely through the natural forest such as ifi 
and nonu trees.  More recently, about 250 alien plant species (many of them weeds) have also become 
established in American Samoa and some of these threaten our native forest.  One that is familiar to 
everyone is the “mile-a-minute” vine, or fuesaina (Mikania micrantha).  This was introduced by 
accident, sometime before 1924.  It is now a major pest in plantations and forests, and has spread 
tremendously following tropical cyclones in the early 1990s.  The vine needs sunlight for its very fast 
growth, and so doesn't do well inside the shade of the mature forest.  The cyclones, however, opened up 
the forests to sunlight by knocking down many trees and breaking off the tops of thousands more.  
Vines like these can form layers several feet thick that can choke the seedlings of native trees and slow 
the recovery of our forests from the damage of the cyclones. 
 
Another well-known pest to agriculture is the giant African 
snail (sisi aferika, Achatina fulica).  This was reportedly 
introduced to the Pacific when the governor of Tahiti 
imported them to satisfy the hunger of his mistress for 
escargot, or edible snails.  Bad, bad idea -- not only were the 
snails not edible, but they quickly spread throughout 
Polynesia, and became a major pest of taro and other crops. 
 
 
Unfortunately, the story does not end there.  In the hopes to 
control the giant snails, a predatory snail (Euglandina rosea) native to Florida was deliberately 
introduced here in 1980.  The idea was that this new snail -- the one with the long pinkish shell -- would 
kill off all the giant snails.  Instead, it has driven the native land snails of the Pacific islands to the edge 
of extinction.  Most of the native snails of Tahiti are now extinct, and the Samoan snails, which used to

be collected by the thousands to make ula, are almost gone.  Meanwhile, the giant snail continues to 
thrive despite the new predator. 
 
Another example is of an invasion that is still under way -- by introduced 
birds.  The first bird introduced to American Samoa was, of course, the 
chicken (moa).  Although these occasionally nest in the forests, they are not 
truly established as wild birds here, and are no threat to our native birdlife.  
However, we do have three introduced bird species on Tutuila.  One of these is 
the manu palagi, or Red-vented Bulbul, the black bird with the crest that is 
common in nearly every village.  This species became established here in the 
1950's.  The other two species both arrived in the 1980's and there seems to be 
no name for them in Samoan.  These are the Common Myna and the Jungle 
Myna.  They look almost the same -- both are blackish brown, with big white 
patches in the wings and tail when they fly.  They are now abundant from 
Pago Pago to Leone and are spreading to the eastern and western ends of the 
island.  None of these three introduced birds has made it to Manu'a, which is 
still home to only our native Samoan birds. 
 
What's wrong with having new kinds of birds to live in our 
villages and gardens?  In some parts of the world, including 
Hawaii, both bulbuls and mynas are serious pests on fruit crops 
such as guava.  Second, they may spread the seeds of pest 
plants, like mile-a-minute vine and “Koster's curse” weed 
(Clidemia hirta), that native birds do not eat as readily.  Third, 
they may drive out native birds, like the iao or Wattled 
Honeyeater.  Although we don't know for sure that this is 
happening, there seem to be more iao around villages in Manu'a 
than on Tutuila where the introduced birds are common.  Finally, the 
introduced birds may spread diseases that will attack our native birds.  
This has happened in Hawaii.  In fact, on the main islands of Hawaii, the 
native birds have been almost completely exterminated.  Every bird you 
seen in the lowlands of Hawaii is an introduced species; the native birds 
hang on only in isolated mountain forests.  We don't want our Samoan 
birds to share this sad fate. 
 
The lesson to learn from these examples is that we must be very, very 
careful when thinking about introducing a new plant or animal to Samoa.  
Even species that seem beneficial, like the predatory snail, can have bad 
and unforeseen effects.  And once a new species is established, it is almost impossible to get rid of.  
Wisely, the Territory has established strict laws against bringing in exotic animals and any plant that 
may become a noxious weed.  Flowering plants, like Honolulu rose (Clerodendrum chinese), may look 
pretty in a garden but turn into major pests when they run wild.   
 
American Samoa's forests and wildlife are unique to all the world, having developed here over hundreds 
of thousands of years in isolation.  We must take care to preserve and protect this special heritage by 
staying alert to keep unwelcome invaders from our shores.

35.  Common pests and diseases of local agricultural plants 
 
 
Gazing up at the beautiful mountains on our islands, we see hillsides of lush green tropical foliage -- a 
picture of botanical health.  That's true for the most part, but if we look closer, we notice that some 
plants can get sick and die, or they can be injured when insects, animals, strong winds or landslides 
damage their leaves, stems or roots.  Sometimes insect pests or diseases spread fast, injuring or killing 
many plants over a large area.  Then we take notice, particularly if we were growing those plants to eat.  
Here are five common plant pests and diseases that can cause serious damage to local agricultural 
plants. 
 
Taro leaf blight disease (lega, laumu).  Many people became acutely 
aware of this plant disease in 1993-94 when it destroyed most of the 
Samoan taro crop.  The disease is caused by a fungus (Phythophthora 
colocasiae) that has been in Fiji for many years, but we don't know how 
it came to American Samoa.  Perhaps it arrived here on taro tops 
(tiapula) from another island, or its fungal spores blew in on the winds 
of Cyclone Val in 1991.  Taro leaf blight is most severe when the 
weather is cool and wet.  Rain splashes spores of the fungus into the air, 
which are then blown by wind from plant to plant.  The expanding 
brown spots made by this fungus cause leaves to die faster than normal, 
so the plant must use its energy to make more leaves instead of storing 
the energy in the taro corm (i'o ole talo) that we want to eat.  Farmers 
are now growing taro varieties from Micronesia that are more resistant 
to the fungus.  The Palau taro, for example, still gets the disease, but less 
severely, so the leaves live longer and corms are of normal size. 
 
Armyworms (anufe-ailatalo).  These insects are more appropriately called cluster caterpillars, because 
they are not worms at all.  They are the juvenile stage of a thick-bodied grayish-brown moth 
(Spodoptera litura) that flies about at night.  It is a serious pest for many crops and may occur 
throughout the year.  The caterpillars are often found on taro leaves in small 
numbers and if found soon enough, they can be picked off by hand before they eat 
too much of the leaves.  Sometimes there are so many that they can't be removed 
fast enough.  As with taro leaf blight, this has a major impact on the 
plant, because energy is taken from the corm (i'o ole talo) to replace 
damaged leaves, so the harvest is reduced.  The female moth lays 200 to 
300 eggs in a cluster during the night.  After the eggs hatch, the young 
larvae feed together, eating larger and larger holes in the leaves as they 
grow, until only the thick ribs of the taro leaf remain.  The mature larva 
falls to the ground, forms a pupa which is the resting stage when the 
caterpillar changes shape and grows wings, and afterwards emerges as 
an adult moth that flies off to lay more eggs.  The complete life cycle, 
eggs to adult, takes only about 30 days.  In American Samoa there are several friendly insects, mainly 
small wasps, that attack and kill armyworms.  But if the armyworms are too numerous, the wasps cannot 
control them and considerable damage to the plant may result.  Unfortunately, spraying the armyworms 
with pesticides also kills the helpful wasps. 
 
Banana bunchy top virus (laufeti'iti'i-vaelusi).  This is one of the most serious diseases of bananas.  The 
virus can be so devastating that some regions of the world affected by it, like parts of Hawaii, are no 
longer able to produce bananas commercially.  For unknown reasons, places like American Samoa are 
less severely affected.  It may have something to do with the small insect, an aphid (afiti), that carries

================================================================================

68
the disease from plant to plant.  Perhaps these aphids are less effective 
virus carriers or they are not very abundant here.  Banana plants infected 
with the virus produce small, narrow leaves with yellow, tattered edges 
bunched together, thus the name “bunchy top”.  When one plant becomes 
infected, the virus spreads to the rest of the plants growing from the same 
“root” mat.  Infected plants stop producing bananas and become shorter 
and shorter until the plant finally dies.  During this time, any aphid feeding 
on an infected plant can carry the virus to an uninfected banana plant.  
Another way the disease is spread is by removing suckers from an infected 
root mat and planting them elsewhere.  There is some concern in American Samoa that the disease could 
begin to spread more widely, but there is a safe way to control bunchy top with a small application of a 
common herbicide [contact Land Grant for details]. 
 
Burrowing nematode (nematota).  This pest attacks the roots of banana plants.  Nematodes are small, 
worm-like residents of soil and water.  Most of them feed on dead plants and other tiny organisms, but 
some attack the roots of living plants.  The burrowing nematode (Radopholus similis) enters young 
banana roots and eats the insides.  When large numbers of nematodes feed on a plant, the roots are so 
damaged that the plant can fall over.  This is one reason why banana plants topple over during strong 
winds or rain, or when they bear a heavy bunch of fruit.  Damaged banana plants usually produce fewer 
and smaller fruits than healthy plants.  Banana varieties grown in American Samoa have no resistance to 
this pest.  The best way to control the nematodes is to remove their source of food (the banana root mat) 
for one year or flood the land, making it unsuitable for the nematode. 
 
Rhinoceros beetle (manuainiu).  These giant beetles cause a 
distinctive diamond-shaped pattern cut out of coconut leaves 
(fronds).  The adult beetle burrows into the tops of coconut 
trees, then down toward their center.  As it burrows, it cuts 
through the new, unopened leaves, so when the leaves open 
later, large wedges of the leaves are missing.  If the midrib is 
cut, the leaf may break on windy days.  While this may 
weaken some leaves and make them look unsightly, we don’t 
know if the damage is serious enough to reduce the number 
of coconuts produced by the tree. 
 
The adult beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) is amazingly large -- almost two inches long -- black and shiny, 
with a horn on its head, like a rhinoceros.  Although it's hard to visualize, the horn apparently helps 
them feed by stabilizing the beetle while it moves its jaws up and down, scraping a hole in the tree.  The 
beetles do not eat the wood but live on sap from the damaged plant cells.  The 
female lays one egg on the ground, usually in dead coconut trees, logs, piles of 
compost or debris.  The young larvae are white with a brown  
head.  They grow almost four inches  
long before they pupate and become  
adult beetles.

37.  The Pacific Pigeon (lupe), Samoa's royal bird 
 
 
The lupe, or Pacific Pigeon, is the king of Samoa's birds and in many ways it is the most culturally 
important bird in our islands.  It is our largest forest bird and is the only one able to feed on, and spread, 
the large seeds of some of our most important rainforest trees.  Its cultural significance is revealed by 
the many Samoan proverbs that relate to the lupe and the art of lupe-hunting.  The importance of lupe is 
also shown by the amazing tia seulupe (star-mounds) which are massive stone platforms built by the 
ancient Samoans, which served at least partly as pigeon-trapping sites. 
 
 
The lupe is a member of a group of birds called the 
imperial pigeons because of their large size and 
dignified appearance.  Most imperial pigeons live in 
the islands of the Pacific, although a few reach the 
mainland of Asia and one occurs in Australia.  
These birds are closely related to the much smaller 
fruit-doves, like the manutagi (Purple-capped Fruit 
Dove) but are only distantly related to the common 
pigeon that waddles around the cities of the world.  
The lupe is found from the islands north of New 
Guinea east through Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Niue, and 
the Cook Islands.  Interestingly, throughout most of 
this wide range, it is usually found on small islands 
and atolls, not on large 'high islands'.  This is most striking in Fiji, where lupe are found on the small 
islands of the Lau group, but not on the large islands of Vanua Levu, Viti Levu or Taveuni.  A closely 
related imperial pigeon replaces the lupe on those high islands. 
 
Lupe are a common sight in forested areas of American Samoa and can be seen flying high over villages 
or bays.  They even visit moso'oi and poumuli trees near houses, if those houses are not too far from 
forests.  Even when not seen, they announce their presence with easy to hear calls:  a low, rising and 
falling moo like that of a cow, or a loud, rolling prrrrrhhh.  One of the benefits of American Samoa's ban 
on hunting lupe (and pe'a) after the cyclones in the early 1990s is that they become less scared of 
people, giving us better chances to see and appreciate these spectacular birds. 
 
Their nests are hard to find.  During all our time in the forests, we have seen only a few.  We have also 
seen evidence of nest-building (for example, lupe flying with sticks in their bills) on several other 
occasions.  All these observations were during the months of January through September.  Lupe nests 
are open platforms of twigs, with no lining.  They are usually placed in dense clumps of leaves high up 
in trees, making them very hard to see. 
 
These birds lay only a single white egg.  Both parents help incubate the egg and feed the chick once it 
hatches.  All members of the pigeon family have an amazing ability:  they feed their young a sort of 
“milk”.  This is a nutritious liquid that is a combination of digested food and other substances secreted 
by special glands in the bird's digestive system.  Both male and female pigeons make this milk, so both 
parents take an equal part in feeding the young.  Information from related species of imperial pigeons 
suggests that lupe eggs take about 27 days to hatch, and that the young spend about 28 days in the nest 
after hatching.  It seems like lupe could nest more than once a year, but most young birds are seen from 
July to August, so most nesting probably occurs at just one time each year. 
 
Lupe eat many different rainforest foods, and not just fruits from favored trees like atone, ma'ali, malili, 
mamala, mamalava, moso'oi or aoa.  They also eat fruits from vines such as mamalupe (pigeon's 


================================================================================

mouthful) and low shrubs like toitoi.  Lupe eat leaves from many different trees, including au'auli, 
a'amati'e and ifi, although in almost all cases they like the young leaves best.  This makes sense, since 
young leaves are probably the most tender and easy to digest, and may have fewer poisonous chemicals 
than old leaves.  Lupe also like flowers on occasion, both from trees like ala'a or ma'ali and from shrubs 
such as ti.  
 
Obviously, the lupe is not a picky eater.  This may explain why it is such a widespread and successful 
bird, since it will eat food from both coastal and mountain areas.  In fact, after Cyclone Val in 1991, 
many lupe on the coast near Vaitogi survived by eating the fruits of toitoi.  Thus, in times of limited 
food, it can find food where other birds might not.  At other times, lupe may eat unusual foods (like 
leaves and flowers) to get certain nutrients, just the way people sometimes take vitamin pills to 
supplement their regular diets.  Lupe are also able to eat some fruits that smaller birds cannot, and so 
may be important for spreading these trees to new areas or even among different islands. 
 
Since the lupe is such an adaptable bird, 
and has been able to recover both from 
human activities like hunting and from 
natural disturbances like the tropical 
cyclones in the early 1990s, it may seem 
surprising that there are many fewer now 
than in earlier times.  The most dramatic 
evidence for this are the many tia seulupe, 
or star mounds, that were built by ancient 
Samoans.  A survey discovered the remains 
of over 60 tia in the eastern part of Tutuila 
alone.  Each tia is a massive stone platform 
with one or more arms extending from it.  
Pigeon-catching huts were built on top of 
the platform, and village chiefs competed to catch the most birds, using a tame lupe as a decoy, and a 
long-handled net to sweep up the flocks of pigeons that were attracted.  Early missionary accounts tell 
how whole villages would spend weeks camping out in the forest around the tia, and that pigeon-
catching season was a time of feasting and partying.  Lupe must have been very abundant to support this 
elaborate cultural activity.  While the tia certainly had ritual and religious importance in addition to their 
use as pigeon-catching sites, the latest studies suggest that pigeon-catching was central to their role in 
ancient Samoan society.  A well-preserved star mound, with explanatory signs, can be visited in 
Ottoville, next to the Fatuoaiga Catholic Church compound. 
 
Now, though, the rainforest that once covered the Tafuna Plain have been cut down.  This type of 
lowland forest, with its abundant mamalava, tava, maota, mamala, and aoa trees, was almost certainly 
the best habitat for lupe in American Samoa. Today, only scattered aoa remain, and lupe are seldom 
seen in Tafuna.  Even though aoa is a valuable food for lupe, we can see that it was the whole forest, 
and not just one kind of tree, that made the Tafuna rainforest so valuable to lupe.  However, this large 
area of habitat is gone, and it seems we will never see as many lupe as did the first Samoans.  Perhaps 
more than any other animal, the lupe is of irreplaceable importance to Samoa, both because of its natural 
role in spreading rainforest seeds, and its cultural role in the stories, proverbs, and heritage of the 
Samoan people.

38.  The rare Many-colored Fruit Dove (manuma) 
 
 
One of the rarest birds that nest on Tutuila is also one of the most beautiful:  the manuma, or Many-
colored Fruit-Dove.   
 
The manuma here is considered a different subspecies than those from Fiji and Tonga because they have 
a slightly different color pattern.  The male manuma is creamy white below and pale yellow above, with 
a dark crimson band across the back, a crimson patch on the forehead, and a purplish-red blotch on the 
breast.  The female is very different and looks like the much more common manutagi, or Purple-capped 
Fruit-Dove.  She is mostly green above and gray below, with a crimson forehead patch.  Unlike the 
manutagi, the female manuma doesn't have a yellow band on its tail. 
 
The manuma was not rare on Tutuila in the 19th and early 20th centuries, according to the journals of 
the early scientific expeditions.  It was usually found in flocks; in 1923 a collector killed 10 birds with a 
single shot into a feeding tree on Ta'u.  However, when the first modern studies of American Samoa's 
birds were done in mid-1970, only a small number of manuma could be found.  Follow-up in the mid-
1980's confirmed the manuma's rarity.  They estimated that the population size on Tutuila was only 
about 80 birds. 
 
After the cyclones in the early 1990s, even 
fewer manuma were seen, and perhaps less 
than 50 remained on all of Tutuila.  Today, 
however, manuma are regularly seen at some 
locations on Tutuila, although not in very 
large numbers.  Biologists would call their 
current distribution rare and local, but they 
are occasionally sighted at many places 
around American Samoa.  Interestingly, 
manuma are much more common in Fiji, 
Samoa and Tonga, sometimes being found 
well away from mature forests. 
 
We know very little about the biology of 
manuma in American Samoa, or why it is 
less common here than elsewhere.  These are 
social birds, often being seen in small flocks, 
but they are also very protective of feeding areas, driving other manuma away from their spot in the 
canopy of a fruiting tree.  One odd thing is that you rarely see the same numbers of each sex -- almost 
always there are several more males than females in any flocks.  We do know that they seem to have a 
very strong preference for the fruits of banyan (aoa) trees, and in American Samoa it is almost always 
seen near or in these trees.  They are also known (from Fiji and Tonga) to eat moso'oi, o'a and magele 
fruits, all of which occur in America Samoa.  Perhaps there are still so few manuma here that they are 
seldom forced to eat anything but their favorite food, but would eat other fruits if necessary. 
 
 
It is dangerous for animals to specialize too much on any one food, especially on remote islands like 
American Samoa.  This can be shown with an example from business.  While a store that sells only 
antique cuckoo-clocks might do fine in New York, Los Angeles, or another big market, it would 
certainly fail very quickly in American Samoa.  There isn't enough business here for such a specialized 
service.  Similarly, an island animal that concentrates on only one kind of food may find itself in trouble 
when that food supply fails.  An animal that lives on a continent can move in search of the food it needs,

but island animals have nowhere else to go.  On larger islands like 
Upolu, Savai'i or Viti Levu, manuma may be able to travel long 
distances to get the food they like the best.  This may be difficult 
on small islands like those of American Samoa, and means that 
animals can only specialize on very reliable food trees such as 
banyan trees (aoa). 
 
These giant banyan trees, which are so important to manuma, face 
many problems of their own.  The Tafuna Plain used to have many 
huge banyans, but most of these have been cut down to make way 
for the exploding human populations in that area.  Moreover, 
banyans, with their large size and spreading crowns, are very 
vulnerable to storm damage.  Many were killed or severely 
damaged by Cyclones Ofa and Val in the early 1990s.  Even those 
that survived the cyclones had their leaves and fruit stripped off, 
leading to a prolonged period of famine for manuma. 
 
There are two things that must happen if the manuma is to survive 
and remain a special part of Samoa's wildlife.  First, the birds must 
be protected from hunting.  Although the manuma is too rare to be 
sought by hunters, a few may have been killed every year by 
hunters out for lupe and manutagi.  When a population is as small 
as the manuma's, even a few preventable deaths per year are a 
significant problem. 
 
The second thing that must be done if the manuma is to survive is 
to protect banyan trees on which they depend.  Without enough banyans to assure a year-round supply 
of its favorite food, the manuma may well become extinct on Tutuila.  People need to protect these 
magnificent trees, which are important food sources for many other Samoan wildlife species, including 
the fruit bats (flying foxes).

39.  The honey-birds 
 
 
The most familiar birds of Tutuila's villages and gardens are the iao (Wattled Honeyeater) and the 
segasegamau'u (Cardinal Honeyeater).  Although they look different, these birds are members of the 
same aiga, the family of birds called the honeyeaters.  Honeyeaters are found throughout the Pacific 
islands, New Guinea, and Australia.  As their name implies, most of them include the sweet nectar of 
flowers in their diet (though none of them eat real honey).  
 
 
The iao or Wattled Honeyeater (Foulehaio carunculata) is the 
commonest forest bird in Samoa.  It is also found in Tonga and 
Fiji.  Although not a particularly beautiful bird, with its greenish-
brown feathers and yellow flaps of bare skin on the face, its 
boundless energy and continuous song enliven our islands.  Its 
bold and fearless nature keeps it busy chasing other birds, and its 
loud alarm calls warn other animals of the lulu (Barn Owl) or 
other danger.  Samoan legend tells that when the iao calls at night, 
it means that ghosts (aitu) are near.   
 
The iao feeds at almost all the flowers of the forest, from small 
atone (nutmeg) flowers to the large crimson blooms of gatae 
(coral tree).  Christmastime is the best time of year for iao, 
because the asi trees are in full bloom.  These white brushy flowers cover the tree crowns and are rich 
with nectar.  At that time, the iao get so full of this nectar that they're like kids full of candy and cake at 
a party -- they rush every which way through the forest, chasing each other and yelling out songs at the 
top of their lungs.  At other times when flowers aren't quite so abundant, they eat a lot of insects as well, 
and also include some soft fruits and berries in their diet. 
 
Even though the iao is our commonest bird, we really don't know very much about its habits.  Their 
nests are beautifully woven cups of grass, typically well-hidden in the dense foliage of a tree.  Usually 
only one or two eggs are laid.  Most nesting appears to take place between September and December. 
 
The segasegamau'u or Cardinal Honeyeater 
(Myzomela cardinalis) is the prettiest bird of 
Samoa's gardens.  Unlike most Samoan birds, 
the male and female Cardinal Honeyeater look 
very different:  the male is bright red, with 
black wings and tail, while the female is a dull 
gray, with a little bit of red on the rump.  These 
tiny birds (the smallest in American Samoa) 
always seem to be active, flitting among the 
aute (ornamental hibiscus), teuila (ginger), and 
nonu (Indian mulberry) in our gardens, or 
sampling nectar at flowers high in the forest 
treetops.  Like the iao, the segasegamau'u is 
very vocal, though not as loud as its larger 
cousin.  Its sweet warbling songs are familiar 
sounds in our villages and plantations. 
 
The segasegamau'u is even more of a honey-bird than the iao.  Though it will occasionally eat small 
insects, it seems very dependent on flower nectar at all times of year.  You can see the difference in the 


================================================================================
PAGE 78 (digital_extraction)
================================================================================

 
 
NATURAL HISTORY GUIDE
 
 
76
beaks of the two birds:  the Cardinal Honeyeater has a very delicate, sharp beak that is perfect for 
slipping into flowers but not so good for grabbing big bugs.  The beak of the Wattled Honeyeater is 
sturdier, more all-purpose:  good both for flowers and insects. 
 
Perhaps because of its love of flowers, the segasegamau'u seems happy to live close to people, in 
gardens and plantations.  Although much less common than the iao in the forest, it is the honeyeater that 
you're likely to see around villages.  Around villages on Tutuila, that is;  surprisingly, the 
segasegamau'u doesn't occur on any of the islands of Manu'a.  Outside of American Samoa, the species 
is found in western Samoa, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands, and very close relatives occur in 
Micronesia and Fiji. 
 
The nest of the Cardinal Honeyeater is a beautiful, delicate cup of fine grass fibers, often decorated with 
moss.  It may be placed high in a tree or almost on the ground in thick foliage.  Four to five tiny eggs are 
laid.  The segasegmau'u seems to nest in all months of the year. 
   
There used to be a third kind of honeyeater on Tutuila, the very large, blackish ma'oma'o or mao 
(Gymnomyza samoensis).  This is a real mystery bird.  Larger than a fuia (Samoan Starling), with loud 
wailing calls, the ma'oma'o is remembered by some of the elders of Tutuila, 
and was collected by scientists here in the 1920s.  However, except for a 
couple of possible sightings in the 1960s and 1970s, it has never been seen 
since.  The ma'oma'o is now found only in the remote mountains of 'Upolu 
and Savai'i, where it is rare and little known.  We will probably never know 
if this bird was once an important part of our forests, or if it occurred here 
only as a rare visitor from western Samoa.  According to legends, hearing 
the wails and screams of the ma'oma'o around a village meant that 
misfortune or a death was about to happen.  Sadly, this prophecy seems to 
have come true for the ma'oma'o itself, which is now in danger of the 
greatest misfortune -- extinction.

40.  Samoa's  starlings 
 
 
 
Starlings are a group of birds with a real image problem.  Over much of the world, “starling” means just 
one thing -- the Common, or European Starling.  This plump, short-tailed, oily black bird was originally 
found in Europe, but it has spread across the cool, temperate countries of the world, from the US to 
China, and from Australia to Argentina.  Everywhere it goes, this bird becomes a pest in both cities and 
the countryside, often driving out native birds and destroying fruit crops. 
 
However, starlings are much more than this one obnoxious species.  Most starlings are found in the 
tropics, and they are a varied, interesting and often beautiful family of birds.  In the Pacific, starlings are 
a characteristic and important part of our native birdlife.  In fact, the most unique of all our birds in 
American Samoa is the fuia or Samoan Starling. 
 
Why is the fuia so special?  Well, not because of its appearance. 
With its dull brownish-black color, the fuia could hardly be called 
beautiful.  No, the fuia is special because it is the only American 
Samoan bird that is “endemic” to Samoa.  This is a word used by 
scientists to describe something found in only one place.  The fuia 
is found only in the islands of American and western Samoa.  All 
our other birds are found in at least one other group of islands.  
Therefore, if the fuia became extinct in the Samoas, there wouldn't 
be a single one left in the world. 
 
Fortunately, there is little danger that the fuia will become extinct.  
It is a survivor, a real Samoan success story.  It is the most 
adaptable bird we have, equally at home in Pago Pago, in small 
villages, in plantations and in the rainforest.  The secret to its adaptability is its eating habits -- a fuia 
will eat almost anything.  They gobble down a wide variety of fruit, from the hard seeds of the mamala 
tree to the big stinky fruits of nonu bushes, from the leathery fruits of lau pata to the soft figs of the 
mati.  They also love insects, including big stick insects, caterpillars, and other agricultural pests.  
Therefore, fuia are friends to farmers, and deserve our protection.  Fuia even eat lizards, and indulge 
their taste for sweets with visits to lick up the nectar of gatae flowers.  Because of their broad diet, fuia 
can always find food, and can live almost anywhere there are trees. 
 
As in most Samoan birds, male and female fuia look almost the same. The species seems to nest in all 
months of the year.  Fuia nests are usually placed in hollows in trees:  snapped-off coconut trunks are 
favorite nest sites.  They will also nest among the dense fronds in the top of a coconut, and even use 
man-made nest sites, like cracked telephone poles.  Fuia eggs are pale blue. 
 
We don't really know very much about the social life of the fuia: for example, do they mate for life?  Do 
they defend territories from other fuia?  Do they stay in one small area, or do they move all around the 
island?  It would be interesting to know more about this most Samoan of our native birds. 
 
The fuia is not our only native starling; it has a small and shy cousin, the miti vao, or Polynesian 
Starling.  Although much less common than the fuia in Samoa, the miti vao has a wider range, being 
found in Fiji, Tonga, and Niue as well as American and western Samoa.  Unlike the fuia, the miti vao is 
almost entirely a bird of the forest, rarely seen in plantations, much less villages.  The reasons for this 
aren't clear.  It seems to have a broad diet, though not quite as accepting as the fuia.  It eats both insects 
and fruit, and is often seen feeding on hard-seeded fruit like mamala and taputoi, though we don't know 


================================================================================

================================================================================

 
 
NATURAL HISTORY GUIDE
 
 
78
if this is because the miti vao prefers such food or because the more aggressive fuia drives it away from 
softer, more nutritious fruit. 
   
Across most of Tutuila you may have some difficulty finding the miti vao.  
There are a few places where they seem to be more common:  Maloata on the 
west end of the island, between Afono and Vatia on the north side, and along 
the Mt. Alava Road.  Look for a small, short-tailed bird with a grayish back, a 
pale breast with darker streaking, and white eyes.  Its quiet but musical 
whistles and trills are very different from the harsh screeches and piercing 
whistles of the fuia.  Miti vao nests are placed in hollows and holes, as are fuia 
nests.  They usually lay two pale blue eggs with brown specklings.  So few 
nests have been found here that we really don't know what time of the year 
this species prefers to breed, or if they may nest at any time.  The miti vao is a 
species that apparently declined after tropical cyclones in 1990-91.  We can 
only hope that populations will increase over time, provided that enough good 
forest remains to give this species the wild habitat it needs. 
 
One interesting thing about the miti vao is that there is a very different form of this bird in Manu'a.  
There, the miti vao are very dark on both upperparts and underparts, with heavy dark streaking on the 
breast.  To become so different, the Manu'a birds must have been separated from those on Tutuila for a 
long time, probably thousands of years. 
 
Unfortunately, the native fuia and miti vao aren't Samoa's only starlings.  Since the 1980's, two other 
members of the starling family have invaded Tutuila, and are now among our commonest birds.  These 
are the black and white mynas that are common from Pago Pago Harbor to Leone.  Two species of 
mynas are established here, both of which were originally native to India.  The Common Myna is 
brownish black, with a yellow bill and a yellow patch of bare skin around the eye.  The Jungle Myna is 
similar, but is darker and slimmer, with an orange beak and no yellow skin around the eye.  Both species 
have large white patches in the wings and tail.  The Common Myna is a major pest in many parts of the 
Pacific, including New Zealand, Hawaii, Fiji, Cook Islands, and French Polynesia.  The Jungle Myna 
has become established only in Fiji and in the Samoan islands.  Both species eat almost anything and are 
very happy in cities and villages, where they eat garbage and nest under roofs even in occupied 
buildings.  These unwelcome invaders can damage guavas and other fruit crops, can spread disease, and  
may compete with our native birds in villages.  So far, the mynas have not yet spread to the Manu'a 
Islands.  It is important that we prevent their spread, and reserve American Samoa, as much as possible, 
for our native birds, including our native starlings, the fuia and the miti vao.

41.  Swiftlets & sheath-tailed bats (o le pe'ape'a):  a mosquito's nightmare 
 
 
High above the villages, valleys, and mountains of Samoa 
flies a deadly predator, as terrifying as a tiger shark -- if you're 
a mosquito (namu), that is.   This is the pe'ape'a, the only bird 
in Samoa that lives entirely on a diet of insects. 
 
But wait a minute -- pe'a means bat:  isn't the pe'ape'a a kind 
of small bat?  Well, yes and no.  Actually two completely 
different creatures share the name pe'ape'a in Samoa.  One is 
a bird, the common White-rumped Swiftlet that is seen flying 
by day all over our islands.  Like all birds, this pe'ape'a has 
feathers and lays eggs.  The other pe'ape'a, more properly 
called pe'ape'avai, is a tiny bat, the Sheath-tailed Bat that is active only at night.  This animal is now almost 
extinct in American Samoa.  Like all bats, this pe'ape'a is a mammal and has fur and gives birth to live 
young that it feeds milk.  The confusion arises because both creatures are tiny, active insect-eaters that are 
almost always in flight, and look similar as they dart and swoop after their prey. 
 
First let's talk about the common pe'ape'a:  the bird.  It belongs to 
a family of birds that are truly creatures of the air, the swifts.  
They have tiny legs and feet, and never land except at nests or in 
their roosting caves.  Capturing and eating food, drinking, 
gathering nesting material, and yes, even mating, are all done in 
flight.  In fact, it is likely that the pe'ape'a is like many other 
kinds of swifts and actually sleeps while flying.  With their long, 
powerful wings and perfectly streamlined bodies, pe'ape'a are 
beautifully adapted for a life of flight. 
 
As they fly, pe'ape'a are continually hunting for small insects, 
especially mosquitoes, flies, and flying ants and termites.  These are 
scooped up in the swift's huge mouth, which is made into an even 
larger trap by long bristle-like feathers around the mouth.  The 
swiftlet is a very useful bird because of all the insects it eats. 
 
When the pe'ape'a finally does decide that it's time to land, it heads for a cave or a protected overhang on a 
cliff.  There it flutters in to grasp the rock, usually hanging vertically.  These caves and sheltered overhangs 
are also the nest site for the swifts.  The nest is a small platform made of moss and fine twigs cemented 
together with the bird's saliva, attached to the rock.  Some close relatives of the pe'ape'a make their nests 
entirely from dried saliva, which (believe it or not) are collected and cooked up to make that famous 
delicacy, bird's nest soup.  The nests of our pe'ape'a are not suitable for this, so anyone with a taste for bird 
saliva will have to look elsewhere. 
 
Swiftlets lay one or two white eggs, and appear to nest at any time of year in Samoa.  Although most nests 
are placed where at least a little light penetrates the cave, some are far back, where it is completely dark.  
How do the swifts find their way in and out?  The answer is that these birds, like many small bats, have the 
amazing ability to echo-locate.  They give loud clicking calls, and then listen to the echoes to orient 
themselves and avoid the walls of the cave.  This ability is fairly undeveloped in birds, and the swiftlets 
don't use it to locate their insect prey, which is why they hunt during the daytime.  In many small bats, 
however, echo-location is incredibly advanced, and is used to hunt tiny insects in complete darkness.  One 
bat with this ability is the Sheath-tailed Bat, which brings us to our second pe'ape'a.

The Sheath-tailed Bat (Emballonura semicaudata) also feeds on 
mosquitoes and other flying insects.  But unlike the swift, this small bat 
does not seem to accept sheltered cliffs as roosting or breeding areas, 
inhabiting only deep and protected caves.  There are few such caves in 
American Samoa, and therefore few good homes for the bat.  Ever since 
Cyclone Ofa in 1990, the known bat caves on Tutuila have been almost 
deserted.  Cyclones Ofa and Val swept water and debris into several 
caves, and the days of strong cyclone winds may have made it impossible 
for the bats to find food.  Unless more bats survive in caves that we don't 
know about, the long-term survival of this useful and fascinating animal 
in American Samoa is doubtful.  There is little we can do to help the bat 
except to stay away from their caves to avoid disturbing the few surviving 
animals.  Sadly, the Sheath-tailed Bat seems to be endangered throughout 
most of its range, including in western Samoa and the Marianas, as well 
as here. 
 
And what about the swift?  Although the 
population of these birds was reduced by 
cyclones in 1990-91, the species seems to 
be in no danger of extinction.  It is still 
possible to see flocks of hundreds of 
swifts swirling together in areas where 
winds collect large numbers of insects, for 
example in Malaeimi Valley and in such 
highland areas as Aoloau and Afono Pass.  
There is every reason to believe that these 
birds will always enliven the Samoan sky 
-- and strike terror into the hearts of 
mosquitoes everywhere.

42.  Familiar and mysterious birds -- the rails 
 
 
The ve'a, or “roadrunner”, is one of Samoa's most recognizable birds.  It is a familiar sight tiptoeing out 
of the grass or running crazily across the road, its neck stretched out and its big feet trying to keep up.  
And its loud, screeching voice is a familiar sound, seeming to complain at the disturbance as we walk to 
the taro patch.  However, for all its abundance, the ve'a is still a little-known bird, quickly disappearing 
from view when disturbed and impossible to follow in the thick grass it favors.  What's more, the ve'a 
has two even more mysterious cousins in American Samoa, and another in western Samoa that, as we 
will see, is the most mysterious Samoan bird of all. 
 
The ve'a and its cousins belong to the family of birds known as the 
rails (named from a old English word meaning to screech -- many of 
these birds have loud, harsh voices).  The ve'a is called the Banded 
Rail, because of the black and white bands on its sides and 
underparts.  It is found all across the Pacific from the Philippines and 
Indonesia to Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, and on to Australia and New 
Zealand.  It is usually common wherever it occurs, with the exception 
of Fiji.  On Fiji this formerly abundant bird has been exterminated on 
the large islands of Vanua Levu and Viti Levu by an introduced predator, the mongoose.  This shows 
how important it is to keep Samoa free from such destructive introduced animals.   
 
The ve'a is a very useful bird, eating many insects that can harm crops.  In fact, it will eat almost 
anything, including fruit, worms, snails, mice, and even toads squashed flat on the roads.  It sometimes 
can be seen deep in the forest, but prefers open areas with dense grass.  Therefore, taro and banana 
plantations are some of its favorite places.  The nest of the ve'a is very hard to find, being built on the 
ground well-hidden in thick grass.   The ve'a lays 4 to 6 eggs.  Like young chickens, young ve'a can run 
around almost as soon as they hatch, and they leave the nest immediately.  It is common to see one or 
two fuzzy, dark gray chicks being led into the grass by their watchful parents.   
 
The other Samoan rail that most people know is the manu ali'i, 
known as the Purple Swamphen.  This large and beautiful bird is a 
dark purple, with a bright red beak that extends up over the 
forehead.  It is even more widely distributed than the ve'a, 
occurring from southern Europe through Africa and all the way to 
Australia and New Zealand.  It is much less common than the ve'a 
in American Samoa, but occurs in low numbers almost 
everywhere, especially in more remote plantation areas.  This bird 
is more often heard than seen; it gives a loud screech with an 
echoing, honking quality. 
 
Like the ve'a, the manu ali'i prefers areas with thick undergrowth 
rather than true forest.  It has a very wide diet, including many insects and much plant material.  It 
sometimes gets into trouble with farmers because of its fondness for green bananas and taro tops.  
However, usually it does little damage, and repays it by eating soldier worms and other crop pests.  In 
former times, the manu ali'i was sometimes hunted, and this may be why it is so shy, usually running or 
flying off with loud screams as soon as it sees you.  Like the ve'a, it nests in thick vegetation, either on 
the ground or in a low bush.  It lays 3 or 4 eggs, and the young leave the nest to follow their parents as 
soon as they hatch.

Our third kind of rail is a real mystery bird, as shown by the fact that it has no 
Samoan name.  In English it is called the Spotless Crake.  Although its wide 
range in the Pacific is very similar to the ve'a, in American Samoa it has only 
been sighted on the island of Ta'u.  The Spotless Crake is very small, only 
about half the size of a ve'a, and is all dark gray except for red legs and eyes.  
It lives in dense grass, almost never flies, and is active at dawn and dusk.  All 
this makes it a very hard bird to find.  In fact, only a single bird was seen by 
biologists in 1986, and another was sighted in 2001. 
  
There is one more kind of rail to mention, and this is the most mysterious Samoan bird of all.  It is the 
puna'e, or Samoan Woodhen.  This bird was first described by scientists in 1874, and last seen in 1908.  
In the whole world, only 11 preserved specimens of it exist.  It apparently occurred only on Savai'i in 
western Samoa. 
 
Old stories tell that the puna'e lived in burrows in the mountain forests, and that it was formerly so 
abundant that it was hunted with nets and dogs specially trained to tell which burrows were occupied.  If 
these stories are true, the puna'e was a very special bird indeed, since no other rails live in burrows.  In 
the last ten years, there has been an unconfirmed report of the puna'e being seen in the mountains of 
Savai'i.  These remote forests have been rarely visited by biologists, and we can hope that this unique 
bird may yet survive in the depths of that misty wilderness.

43.  Our strange winter visitor, the Cuckoo (aleva) 
 
 
The aleva or Long-tailed Cuckoo is a very odd bird, no doubt about it.  For one thing, when the weather 
starts to get cold in its summer home, the aleva migrates north for the winter.  For another, it has a 
highly unusual home life:  it doesn't build its own nest or care for its own young, but abandons its eggs 
in the nests of other birds, to be raised not only by strangers, but by completely different kinds of birds.  
The aleva lives and breeds in New Zealand for half of the year.  But when winter approaches, around 
March or April, the aleva leaves its chilly home islands, and flies north into sunny Polynesia.  In fact, it 
is the only land bird to migrate north to spend the winter with 
us (although a few aleva may be found here year-round).  
The aleva's winter range extends all the way from Palau on 
the west to Pitcairn Island on the east, but the largest 
numbers winter in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga.  Here it can be 
found on any island, from the mountainous interiors of the 
largest high islands to the coastal vegetation of tiny atolls.  
Wherever it ends up, the aleva feeds mostly on large insects, 
including caterpillars and stick insects, but also small lizards. 
 
The aleva is a hard bird to see, usually creeping without a sound through dense foliage.  In fact, we 
most often see aleva because they are being chased by other birds, especially the iao (Wattled 
Honeyeater).  Iao seem to hate aleva, and chase them vigorously, with loud scolding cries.  It is very 
interesting to try to figure out why they do this.  There are at least three possibilities.  It may be that 
aleva will eat eggs if they get the chance; however, this has never been observed.  Second, in flight the 
aleva looks much like a hawk, with its pointed wings and long tail.  Perhaps iao mistake the aleva for a 
hawk, and think they are chasing a dangerous predator away.  But there are no hawks in Samoa. 
Therefore, this explanation would mean that iao still have an instinctive fear of hawk-like birds 
thousands of years after they last saw a hawk (which was probably when the ancestors of our iao came 
here from Fiji).  The last explanation seems even more far-fetched.  This is that the iao chases the aleva 
because it is afraid that the cuckoo will lay its eggs in the iao's nest.  To understand this possibility, we 
must discuss the strange breeding behavior of the aleva. 
 
Like many other members of the cuckoo family, the aleva is a nest parasite.  This means that it secretly 
lays its eggs in other birds' nests.  The unlucky host birds think that the cuckoo egg is their own, and 
raise it alongside their own babies.  Usually the baby cuckoo is much larger than the babies of its hosts, 
who are unable to compete and starve to death.  Many New Zealand birds, including honeyeaters related 
to the iao, recognize the aleva and chase it away.  This makes a lot of sense in New Zealand, where the 
aleva breeds.  But the aleva never breeds on its wintering grounds in Polynesia.  Therefore, the iao has 
no reason to fear that the aleva will lay eggs in its nest.  Could there be an instinctive hatred of cuckoos 
in all members of the honeyeater family?  Like many questions in biology, this one would be hard to 
answer, but it's still fun to think about. 
 
Many older Samoans say that aleva used to be much more common than they are today.  The aleva is 
now a rare sight on Tutuila.  It's hard to know just how rare the bird really is because of its secretive 
habits.  If you see one, consider yourself lucky, and take a moment to think about the many mysteries in 
the life of this strange visitor to our shores.

44.  Barn owls (lulu) -- spirit of the night 
 
 
The barn owl or lulu is a highly beneficial bird in American Samoa, but some people fear it because they 
associate it with ghosts or aitu.  Its ghostly white appearance and its preference for flying at night 
enhance its reputation as a mysterious bird.  It is not uncommon when driving around Tutuila at night to 
see one perched on a telephone pole or gliding across the road.  Its eerie screech pierces the night and 
can be frightening if you are not expecting it. 
 
Owls are carnivores that usually swallow their prey whole.  A few 
hours after swallowing a rat (isumu) or some other prey, owls 
regurgitate or spit out a pellet of indigestible bones and hair about 
two inches long and one inch in diameter.   By examining these 
pellets, we can determine what the lulu eats.  In the remains of 482 
meals, rats made up most (81%) of those meals, followed by mice 
(9%), geckos (7%), and bones of a few birds (2%), which consisted 
of White Terns (manu sina), Wattled Honeyeaters (iao), mynas, and 
Samoan Starlings (fuia). 
 
No chicken remains were found, but this was not unexpected because 
owls do not generally attack large prey.  Chickens and fruit bats (pe'a) 
are too heavy for an owl to carry and too large to swallow whole.  
Instead, they would typically eat the meat and viscera at the site of the kill.  Soft tissues such as these 
would be totally digested and not be found in pellets.  We have other evidence that one flying fox was 
killed and partially eaten by an owl. 
 
Even though lulu occasionally take a bird, bat or even a chicken, their value in controlling rat 
populations is tremendous.  One pair of owls may catch 2-4 rats per day.  Without owls, Tutuila and 
Manu'a would probably be over-run with rats.  A lulu seen flying through a village should not be feared 
or hated but welcomed, because it will probably mean one less rat near your fale.

45.  Birds of wetland and reef:  Gray Duck and Reef Heron 
  
 
 
Two very different birds depend on Samoa's shallow water habitats.  One is the familiar matu'u, or Pacific 
Reef-Heron, a bird that is seen nearly every day by anyone visiting Samoa's shoreline.  The other is Samoa's 
only duck, the toloa or Gray Duck, a bird that is so rare that most young Samoans have probably never seen 
one.  
 
It comes as a surprise to some people that we don't have more kinds of ducks 
in Polynesia.  After all, ducks like water, and we've got plenty of that, right?  
Well, we've got plenty of salt water, but very few lakes, marshes, or large 
streams of fresh water.  Almost all ducks prefer fresh water, and even the few 
kinds of “sea ducks” eat mostly seagrass and other plants that aren't found 
around Samoa's coral reefs.  Therefore, there aren't many suitable homes for 
toloa in American Samoa.  These suitable homes are the fresh and brackish 
(fresh/saltwater mix) water wetlands. 
 
“Wetlands” is a word that we've been hearing a lot lately.  It refers to areas of land that are permanently or 
periodically flooded or submerged in shallow water.  So much wetland habitat has been lost in the United 
States, primarily through draining and filling, that strict federal laws have been passed protecting wetlands.  
Locally, the Coastal Zone Management Program is responsible for protecting our remaining wetlands, 
which serve vital roles as nurseries for fish and crabs, natural water purification and recharge areas, sites for 
taro production, and homes for rare plants and wildlife.  There used to be extensive mangrove (togo) 
swamps bordering Pago Pago Bay, but these were filled in long ago, before the negative environmental 
consequences of such activities were understood.  The largest remaining wetland areas here are the pala 
lagoons in Nu'uuli and Leone and the marshes and Pala Lake on Aunu'u Island.  There are also many other 
small but important wetlands remaining in both Tutuila and  Manu'a. 
 
All of these areas were once home to toloa.  
However, as wetlands were filled in and as shotguns 
became available, this once-popular game bird 
became rarer and rarer.  During a major survey of 
Samoan birds in 1986, not a single toloa was seen, 
leading to the concern that this bird might be extinct 
in American Samoa.  Happily, this is not the case.  A 
few toloa still live in the territory, mostly on Aunu'u, 
where the village leaders have taken an active role in 
protecting their ducks.  This bird, and the wetlands it 
depends upon, need our continued protection if it is 
ever to recover to healthy population levels. 
 
The toloa is a “dabbling duck”.  This means that it 
doesn't dive under the water to feed, but rather tips down, with its tail in the air and its neck stretching under 
the water, to reach the plants and small insects and snails that it feeds on.  Although it sometimes swims in 
the sea, it does not feed there, and, like most ducks, it does not eat fish. 
 
One interesting thing about the toloa is that is doesn't always nest near the water.  It may build its nest in tall 
dense grass, or place it in a low tree hollow.  Five to ten pale green eggs are laid.  The journey of the young 
ducks from the nest to the safety of the water is a dangerous one, and usually only one or two ducklings 
make it.

The toloa is a great wanderer.  The bird is found across a huge geographic area, extending from Indonesia 
to French Polynesia, and south to New Zealand and Australia.  The toloa is a strong, fast flier, and 
commonly flies between islands.  It seems likely that the small population on Aunu'u, which was apparently 
absent in the late 1980's, may have recolonized American Samoa from western Samoa, where the duck is 
slightly more common.  This gives us reason to hope that the toloa may return to areas that it formerly used, 
if the wetlands are preserved, and the duck is protected from hunting.  So ... if you see a toloa, consider 
yourself lucky, and please don't disturb it.  Perhaps one day Samoa's special duck will once again be a 
common sight. 
 
The matu'u, or Pacific Reef-Heron, is a common sight today.  With its 
long legs and long neck, often curved in an S-shape, the matu'u is one of 
Samoa's most recognizable birds.  One interesting fact about the matu'u is 
that it comes in two color forms, either dark gray or pure white, although 
almost all the matu'u in Samoa are dark gray.  In other areas, particularly 
atolls like Swains Island or Rose Atoll, almost all the matu'u are white.  It 
seems that in Polynesia the dark forms are found on volcanic islands, with 
dark lava rocks, while the white birds occur on atolls with white sandy 
shorelines.  In many other parts of its range, however, including Fiji, both 
white and gray forms occur commonly in the same area.  The reason for 
the matu'u's two color forms remains a unclear.  
 
The matu'u is the master spear fisherman of the bird world.  It stalks slowly 
across the reef flat, scanning for the slightest movement, and then throws its 
long neck forward as fast as lightning, catching its prey with its long sharp 
beak.  It feeds on a wide variety of reef creatures, including fish, crabs, and snails. 
 
Although the matu'u usually makes its living feeding on the coral reef, it also uses the freshwater wetlands 
of Samoa.  Mangrove areas like the Nu'uuli Pala are frequent feeding sites, and the birds will also hunt for 
food in freshwater streams.  These rainforest stream valleys are the matu'u's favored nesting areas, where 
the herons build their large nests high in the trees.  Some matu'u also nest on offshore islets, and have even 
been reported to nest on ledges in caves.  Usually three pale green eggs are laid. 
 
Strict protection of Samoa's wetlands is essential if the toloa is to regain its place among our familiar native 
birds and if the matu'u is to continue to be a common resident of our shoreline villages.  Please help spread 
the message that landfills kill a very important part of Samoa's natural environment -- our wetlands.

46.  Shorebirds (o tuli):  incredible voyagers 
 
 
April/May is the time of year when some familiar visitors leave American Samoa and begin an 
incredible and perilous journey home.  These visitors are the shorebirds, or tuli.  Three different kinds of 
tuli are common visitors here between the months of September and April:  the Pacific Golden Plover, 
the Wandering Tattler, and the Ruddy Turnstone. 
 
During the northern summer, all three tuli nest in Alaska and 
northern Canada.  The plover and the turnstone nest in the tundra, 
where their neighbors are caribou and grizzly bears.  The tattlers 
nest by icy mountain streams, sharing their world with mountain 
sheep and golden eagles.  But when the northern days grow 
shorter and colder, the birds probably begin to dream of the 
beaches and reefs of Polynesia, for they set out on one of the 
greatest of all animal journeys.  From gathering places on the 
coasts of Alaska, the tuli take off to fly non-stop over 3,000 miles 
of open ocean to the Hawaiian Islands.  These birds cannot land 
on the water and take a rest -- their feathers are not waterproof, so 
if they land in the water, they drown.  Not only is this flight an 
amazing physical feat, but it requires tremendous navigational 
abilities to find tiny specks of land lost in the featureless sea.  
After a well-earned rest in Hawaii, the tuli take off again for 
another flight over thousands of miles of ocean to reach Samoa. 
 
Here, each kind of tuli takes up a slightly different lifestyle.  
The Golden Plover is often seen on the beaches, but even more 
commonly can be found searching for food on the short grass of 
malae, parks, the golf course, and the airport.  We can only hope 
it will not be harmed from competing with the many myna birds 
that now occupy these areas.   
 
Although this plover is plain brown during most of its stay in 
American Samoa, it gets a beautiful new set of feathers just 
before it heads north:  a golden-spangled back and jet black 
underparts.  The plover is the commonest tuli in Samoa, and it 
features in many myths and legends.  Tuli the Messenger is one 
manifestation of Tagaloa, the supreme god of the ancient 
Samoans, and in one version of the Samoan creation story, 
Tagaloa created the first dry land as a resting place for tuli. 
 
The Wandering Tattler is a beachcomber.  It is almost always seen on beaches or the reef, using its long 
beak to pry small crabs, worms, and other delicacies out of the sand or coral.  It is a solitary bird, 
soberly dressed in gray.  When disturbed, the tattler's loud cries explain how it got its name. 
 
The turnstone was named for its way of feeding.  These small, energetic, sociable birds like to 
vigorously flip over small stones, bits of seaweed, or debris in search of food hiding beneath.  They can 
be seen either on the beach or in grassy areas.  The turnstone has a beautiful pattern of black and white 
patches on its back when it flies, and in breeding plumage, it is a handsome bird with orange-brown, 
black, and white patterning.

All these tuli can usually be seen in such places as Sliding Rock and Pala Lagoon from September to 
April.  But in April/May, all but a few stragglers will have left Samoa to take their long, long trip back 
to Alaska.  So, the next time you see some tuli, wish them a safe journey and try to imagine, maybe with 
a little envy, their great adventure.

47.  Samoa's seabirds: tava'e, gogo and manu sina 
 
 
The islands of Samoa are true oceanic islands:  they are not riders on the skirts of any continent, but are the 
tops of huge mountains, rising up through the great ocean depths.  Surrounded as they are by thousands of 
square miles of ocean, it is not surprising that the Samoan Islands have more kinds of seabirds than any 
other type of native wildlife.  In all, 20 species of seabirds are known to nest in Samoa (and many more 
can be seen passing through our area), compared to 18 kinds of resident landbirds and only three kinds of 
mammals (all bat species). 
 
Our seabirds are a diverse group.  Some, such as shearwaters 
and petrels (ta’i’o), are rarely seen, but nest in burrows on the 
tops of mountains like Lata and Pioa.  Their eerie calls can be 
heard at night in places such as Afono Pass.  Others like 
frigatebirds (atafa) and boobies (fua'o) are seen flying around 
our coasts, but nest on the high cliffs of Pola or in trees on the 
remote north side of Tutuila.  The tern family has many 
different looking birds living here, including the solid black and 
brown noddies (gogo), the beautiful blue-grey noddy (laia), the 
white tern (manu sina), and the grey-backed tern (gogo sina).  
Here we will discuss the three most common and conspicuous 
seabirds of Tutuila:  the tava'e, manu sina, and gogo. 
 
The tava'e (tava'esina), or White-tailed Tropicbird, is one of Samoa's most beautiful creatures.  The sight 
of a tava'e soaring overhead is unforgettable, as its gleaming white feathers and graceful tail streamers 
blaze against the deep indigo of the Polynesian sky.  Happily, it is also a familiar sight, as these birds are 
common all around Tutuila. 
 
The tava'e, so graceful in the air, is comical and awkward on land, so much so that Samoan legends 
describe the bird as lazy or dim-witted.  In fact, tava'e are probably as industrious and intelligent as your 
average bird.  Their awkwardness results from the fact that their legs and feet are tiny for the size of the 
bird, and are placed far back on the body.  Thus, all tava'e can do on land is to shuffle along, bumping their 
powerful chest muscles on the ground.  Luckily for them, tava'e spend little time on land.   
 
They typically nest high in rainforest trees, preferring protected sites such as large hollows or clumps of 
ferns or other plant material.  Here they lay a single large egg.  At hatching, the young tropicbird is one of 
the cutest of all baby birds -- a completely round ball of silvery fluff.  As they grow, they molt into their 
juvenile plumage, with black and white barred feathers across their back. This is their appearance when 
they leave the nest on their first flight toward the sea, often a mile or more away.  The fledglings often 
seem to have problems with this flight, based on the number of young tava'e that are brought in to our 
office, unable to fly.  These youngsters are usually very gentle, and with several days of feeding with 
sardines or other fish, they often regain their strength and are able to fly away. 
 
Tava'e are master fishermen, making plunging dives for squid and a variety of small fish.  One of their 
favorites are flying fish -- I've often wondered whether they catch the flying fish in the air or while they're 
swimming.  The tava'e is well known to Samoan fishermen, who watch its behavior at sea to help them 
locate schools of masimasi and other fish.  The tava'e is important to human fishermen for another reason: 
its feathers are prized for fishing lures.  The gleaming white breast feathers are tied to hooks and used to 
attract malau (squirrelfish) and other fish.  It is a traditional belief that only feathers from living birds stay 
dry and shiny after repeated use, and it was a badge of honor for a Samoan youth to climb a tava'e nesting 
tree and pluck out the plumes.  This supplied a lure while causing no harm to the birds.

The tava'e has a close relative, the Red-tailed Tropicbird, or tava'e'ula, that nests on Rose Atoll.  This bird 
is larger and heavier than the tava'e, with shining pinkish-white feathers and red tail plumes.  It typically 
nests on the ground among rocks, roots, or logs.  In former times, this bird apparently nested on Tutuila, 
but it no longer does so.  The reason may be the abundance of introduced animals such as rats, cats, and 
dogs that attack ground-nesting birds on Tutuila. 
 
Our next seabird, the manu sina or manusina (also called 
the white tern or common fairy tern) is perhaps Samoa's 
most familiar bird.  At almost any time of day you can lift 
your eyes to the mountains and see these pure white birds 
circling effortlessly over the green forest.  I recommend 
contemplation of this lovely sight to anyone feeling 
burned out by the noise and ugliness that sometimes 
surround us at eye level.  It's always a nice reminder of 
the beauty of the natural Samoan environment. 
 
The manu sina is found throughout the tropical oceans of 
the world and seems able to adapt to human-altered 
landscapes better than do many seabirds.  Those of you familiar with Honolulu may have noticed manu 
sina fluttering in the trees along Kalakaua Avenue, where they actually nest in the middle of Waikiki. 
 
The nesting behavior of manu sina is remarkable indeed.  In fact, “nesting” is being a bit generous, since 
manu sina make no nest at all.  Instead, they balance their large single egg in a knothole, stub, or other 
more or less precarious perch in a tree.  They will even accept man-made structures like rooftops and 
ledges.  It is amazing to see a manu sina stubbornly sitting on its egg as a strong tropical storm swings its 
branch wildly.  Risky though is seems to us, this nesting strategy certainly works, as the White Tern is a 
common and widespread bird. 
 
Manu sina feed on a variety of small ocean fish, which they pluck from the surface.  Unlike all the other 
seabirds of Samoa, the manu sina carries fish back to its chick in its beak, rather than swallowing them 
first.  In fact, they have the incredible ability to capture several tiny fish in a row, shift them crosswise in 
their bill, and carry them back home, without dropping a one.  How do they do it? 
 
The final seabird to be discussed is the gogo, or Brown 
Noddy.  Like the manu sina, this bird is a member of 
the tern family, but these two cousins are different in 
many ways.  For starters, the gogo is as dark as the 
manu sina is light.  It is dark chocolate brown all over, 
except for the top of the head, which is a whitish-gray 
cap.  It is also more sociable than the manu sina, 
usually nesting in loose groups, or colonies.  The gogo 
is very flexible in its nesting behavior.  On Tutuila, 
gogo usually nest high in trees in forested stream 
valleys, building bulky nests of dead leaves and other plant material.  They also sometimes nest on cliffs, 
for example at Fagatele Bay.  On Rose Island and other atolls, gogo are happy to lay their eggs on the 
ground, making only a small scrape in the coral rubble, which they often decorate with empty seashells 
and even bones.  Like other tropical seabirds, the gogo typically lays only a single egg. 
 
There is another gogo here, the Black Noddy, which is smaller and blacker than the Brown Noddy, and 
has a different way of flying.  In good light they are separated from Brown Noddies that have a distinct

brown and black pattern on the wings.  Black Noddies are more often seen feeding in flocks with manu 
sina than are Brown Noddies.  The diet of the gogo is apparently similar to that of the manu sina, since 
both birds feed on small fish and squid captured near the surface.  How do different birds with such 
similar food habits coexist?  Maybe each catches just a particular kind or size of fish, or dives to a 
certain depth. 
 
One of the most interesting sights in American Samoa is a foraging flock of seabirds.  These groups can 
have from five or ten to hundreds of birds.  They are a great chance to see the many different ways 
seabirds catch fish:  laia flutter above the waves, sometimes dangling their feet into the water, gogo 
swoop low over the water, fua'o dive into the water with a huge splash, and atafa wait until a fua'o 
catches some fish, then chase it and take the fish from it.  The birds you see in such a flock are a good 
indication of which fish are below the water, something Samoan fishermen use to locate schools of fish.  
A flock of small birds like White Terns and Black Noddies usually indicates skipjack or small tuna, 
while large flocks of fua'o indicate larger fish. 
 
As fishing partners or simply as beautiful neighbors on our islands, Samoa's seabirds are a special part of 
our wild heritage.

48.  The special birds of Manu'a 
 
 
The Manu'a Islands are famous for their history, culture, and spectacular beauty, but the wildlife of Ta'u, 
Ofu, and Olosega is also special.   Given that these islands are only 60 miles east of Tutuila, you might 
expect that the same kinds of birds and animals would be found in both places.  But in fact there are four 
kinds of birds living in Manu'a that do not occur on Tutuila.   
 
The most beautiful of these is Samoa's only parrot, the segavao, or Blue-
crowned Lory.  This is a tiny jewel of a bird, only 7 inches long, but colored 
with emerald green back and wings, ruby red face and throat, and a sapphire 
blue crown.  In historic times, these colorful feathers were used to decorate 
finemats. 
 
Segavao often come in to villages to feed on the nectar of coconut (niu) and 
coral tree (gatae) flowers, but they are not easy to see in spite of their bright 
colors.  Your first clue to their presence is often their high-pitched whistles, 
given as they fly overhead or scramble in the top of a coconut tree.  This 
pretty little parrot is also found in western Samoa, but does not live on 
Tutuila.  We don't know why.  Tutuila seems to have some of the food 
segavao like, including aoa fruits, but perhaps there are not enough flowers 
all year round.  In the forests of Manu'a, segavao particularly like the flowers 
of Astronidium pickeringii, a species for which we know no Samoan name.  
This tree of the melastome family is common in the high forests of Manu'a. 
 
Another special bird of Manu'a is the sega o le vau, the Lesser  (Fiji) 
Shrikebill.  This is a charcoal-grey bird with tiny white corners on its 
tail, although if you get a very good look you might see a little brown 
along its sides, or its blue-grey legs.  Sega o le vau are about the same 
size as iao, but are stockier and have bigger heads and wider beaks.  
This bird is found nowhere else in the Samoan islands. It also occurs in 
Fiji, but birds there look very different and are mostly brown.  Sega o 
le vau can be seen on all three islands of Manu'a, but they are not 
closely tied to a particular habitat.  They are usually heard before they 
are seen, as they often make a loud chatter as they poke through dead 
vines or ie'ie leaves.  They also make a clear two-toned whistle, and 
may answer if you imitate this call.  These birds seem sociable and often move through the forest in 
small groups of two or three.  They often ignore people, and if you sit very still they will sometimes 
feed within arms reach.  
 
The Spotless Crake is a small black bird that looks like a half-grown Banded 
Rail (ve'a).  It is extremely rare and has only been found in American Samoa 
on Ta'u Island.  It lives in dense grass, is active mostly at dawn and dusk, and 
is very shy.  All these habits makes it very hard to see, and only a few birds 
have been sighted in recent years. 
 
Another rare land bird in American Samoa is the tuaimeo, the Friendly 
Ground-Dove.  This bird gets its name because it was first discovered in 
Tonga, once called the Friendly Islands.  A better name would probably be the Shy Ground-Dove, as 
this bird will sit very still on a low branch and hope you do not notice it.  Your best chance of seeing 
one is if it happens to be walking in the path you are using, as it may run ahead of you or fly up onto a

tree limb.  You may also hear its call, a single, drawn-out coo that is slightly lower and much longer 
than the rapid, short coos of the fruit-doves manutagi or manuma.  If you are very close, you can hear a 
slight variation in the tone of the call.  Tuaimeo are mostly dark brown birds, although like many doves 
the males can be very pretty if seen in good light.  Unlike 
other doves or pigeons in American Samoa, this bird spends 
most of its time on the ground, where it feeds on fallen seeds, 
fruit, and buds.  Tuaimeo can be seen on Ofu and Olosega, as 
well as in Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa.  
 
Birds are not the only unique wildlife of Manu'a.  For 
example, Ta'u is home to American Samoa's only native 
snake, the gata, or Pacific Boa.  This dark brown snake is 
harmless to people, apparently living mostly on a diet of lizards (mo'o and pili), birds and bird eggs.  It 
is rare, or at least very hard to find in the deep forests of Ta'u, and should be left undisturbed whenever 
it is found. 
 
Why is the wildlife in Manu'a so different from that on Tutuila?  One reason could be the wildness of 
Manu'a:  large areas, mostly on Ta'u, are untouched by villages, plantations, and roads.  Another reason 
may be that in Manu'a the native birds have fewer problems caused by introduced birds, animals, 
diseases, or plants.  Or, it could be that the terrain in Manu'a, which has many areas with steep yet 
forested ridges that have quite different plants than similar ridges, such as Alava, on Tutuila.  Each of 
the special birds of Manu'a may have different reasons for being there, but the absence of all of them 
from Tutuila suggests there might be a single explanation for this pattern, and this remains an interesting 
biological question about American Samoa.

49.  American Samoan Christmas bird count 
 
 
“Christmas counts” are conducted by bird enthusiasts almost everywhere, including American Samoa.  
The survey is conducted on a single day during the period December 14 to January 5.  Counts are made 
within a 15-mile diameter circle.  The numbers and species of birds seen will depend on the number of 
observer teams.  On 17 December 1992, seven observers traveling in three parties recorded 1337 birds 
of 30 species on Tutuila Island, American Samoa: 
 
 
227  Red-footed Booby 
143  White Tern 
131  Pacific Golden Plover 
118  White-rumped Swiftlet 
116  Wattled Honeyeater  
 97  Samoan Starling   
 91  Red-vented Bulbul (alien)  
 86  Brown Noddy  
 46  Jungle Myna (alien)  
 31  Brown Booby   
 30  Purple-capped Fruit-Dove   
 27  Cardinal Honeyeater  
 25  Common Myna (alien)  
 24  White-tailed Tropicbird   
 23  Ruddy Turnstone  
 21  Banded Rail 
 21  Collared Kingfisher  
 14  Pacific Pigeon (alien) 
 13  Reef Heron   
 12  Wandering Tattler  
  9  Polynesian Starling  
  7  Lesser Frigatebird   
  6  Bridled Tern  
  4  frigatebird spp. 
  4  Great Frigatebird  
  4  Many-colored Fruit-Dove 
  3  Sanderling 
  1  Purple Swamphen   
  1  Blue-gray Noddy  
  1  Rock Dove 
  1  Barn Owl 
 
The count circle was centered at the peak of Matafao Mountain and included the entire island except the 
areas west of Fagamalo and Nua villages, and east of Aoa and Alofau villages.  The total viewer-hours 
were 9.5:  3.5 hours on foot and 6 hours by vehicle. Participants traveled 2.5 miles on foot and 35 miles 
by vehicle. Percentage of time in each habitat was:  30% in villages, 30% in nearshore/reef, 10% in 
plantations, 10% in montane scrub, 10% in rainforest, and 10% in shore/scrub. 
 
Four of the species recorded are introductions.  The Rock Dove is not established as a breeding bird in 
the territory and we believe that the one observed is an escapee from a small colony of homing pigeons 
maintained by a private individual in Tafuna.  The Red-vented Bulbul has been established on Tutuila 
since at least the early 1960's.  Both species of mynas became established here in the 1980's and are 
currently undergoing rapid range expansions in urban areas. 
 
The observation of Bridled Terns is noteworthy.  This 
species has been considered a rare visitor to American 
Samoa and is not a confirmed breeder.  However, during 
the Christmas Count, we observed at least two pairs of 
birds repeatedly landing on ledges of the Pola Islet.  This is 
the primary breeding area for boobies and frigatebirds on 
Tutuila.  The terns' behavior suggested breeding activity, 
but we could not confirm this.  We have repeatedly 
observed Bridled Terns in Pago Pago Harbor and at various 
points along the coast between October and March.

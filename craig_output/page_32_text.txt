After spawning, the fertilized eggs drift away with the currents.  About one month later, the small 
manini that survived this larval stage are ready to settle back onto the reef. 
 
Pone (Ctenochaetus striatus, or the lined bristletooth surgeonfish) are a different type of surgeonfish in 
two respects.  They are a dull brown color and they have funny teeth.  Their lack of spectacular 
coloration is somewhat of an embarrassment in tropical waters which are renown for brightly colored 
fish.  Pone are, however, one of the most abundant fishes on the reefs, so they must be doing something 
right. 
 
Their teeth have evolved very differently from 
other surgeonfishes because what they feed 
upon is quite different.  Instead of having actual 
teeth to bite off algae the way that alogo and 
manini do, pone have a mouthful of bristles 
which they use as a comb or brush to collect the 
detritus that lies on reef surfaces.  The detritus 
they eat includes all the small bits and pieces of 
formerly living plants and animals.  The detritus 
in your backyard, for example, might include 
grass clippings, old ulu leaves, decaying 
coconut husks, rotting papayas, and numerous 
unseen dead insects.  Not a pretty meal, to be 
sure. 
 
Detritus is found everywhere, but few large animals can make a meal out 
of it.  Pone can, and that may account for their abundance and widespread 
distribution on coral reefs. 
 
Every several years or so, pone have a very successful spawning event, 
and uncountable numbers of their young (pala'ia) settle onto the reef.  
Palaâ€™ia are very pretty and look like small dark alogo.  But their beauty 
fades as they grow, and in just a few weeks they turn brown in color.

49.  American Samoan Christmas bird count 
 
 
“Christmas counts” are conducted by bird enthusiasts almost everywhere, including American Samoa.  
The survey is conducted on a single day during the period December 14 to January 5.  Counts are made 
within a 15-mile diameter circle.  The numbers and species of birds seen will depend on the number of 
observer teams.  On 17 December 1992, seven observers traveling in three parties recorded 1337 birds 
of 30 species on Tutuila Island, American Samoa: 
 
 
227  Red-footed Booby 
143  White Tern 
131  Pacific Golden Plover 
118  White-rumped Swiftlet 
116  Wattled Honeyeater  
 97  Samoan Starling   
 91  Red-vented Bulbul (alien)  
 86  Brown Noddy  
 46  Jungle Myna (alien)  
 31  Brown Booby   
 30  Purple-capped Fruit-Dove   
 27  Cardinal Honeyeater  
 25  Common Myna (alien)  
 24  White-tailed Tropicbird   
 23  Ruddy Turnstone  
 21  Banded Rail 
 21  Collared Kingfisher  
 14  Pacific Pigeon (alien) 
 13  Reef Heron   
 12  Wandering Tattler  
  9  Polynesian Starling  
  7  Lesser Frigatebird   
  6  Bridled Tern  
  4  frigatebird spp. 
  4  Great Frigatebird  
  4  Many-colored Fruit-Dove 
  3  Sanderling 
  1  Purple Swamphen   
  1  Blue-gray Noddy  
  1  Rock Dove 
  1  Barn Owl 
 
The count circle was centered at the peak of Matafao Mountain and included the entire island except the 
areas west of Fagamalo and Nua villages, and east of Aoa and Alofau villages.  The total viewer-hours 
were 9.5:  3.5 hours on foot and 6 hours by vehicle. Participants traveled 2.5 miles on foot and 35 miles 
by vehicle. Percentage of time in each habitat was:  30% in villages, 30% in nearshore/reef, 10% in 
plantations, 10% in montane scrub, 10% in rainforest, and 10% in shore/scrub. 
 
Four of the species recorded are introductions.  The Rock Dove is not established as a breeding bird in 
the territory and we believe that the one observed is an escapee from a small colony of homing pigeons 
maintained by a private individual in Tafuna.  The Red-vented Bulbul has been established on Tutuila 
since at least the early 1960's.  Both species of mynas became established here in the 1980's and are 
currently undergoing rapid range expansions in urban areas. 
 
The observation of Bridled Terns is noteworthy.  This 
species has been considered a rare visitor to American 
Samoa and is not a confirmed breeder.  However, during 
the Christmas Count, we observed at least two pairs of 
birds repeatedly landing on ledges of the Pola Islet.  This is 
the primary breeding area for boobies and frigatebirds on 
Tutuila.  The terns' behavior suggested breeding activity, 
but we could not confirm this.  We have repeatedly 
observed Bridled Terns in Pago Pago Harbor and at various 
points along the coast between October and March.

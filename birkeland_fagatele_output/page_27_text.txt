Fig. 20. Field observations suggest that CCA (mostly Porolithon craspedium and Porolithon 
onkodes s.l.) react more strongly than corals to increased available carbonate ions (as measured 
by aragonite saturation state) and are thereby overgrowing corals, reducing the chances of corals 
to grow into the larger size classes. 
It could be that the carbonate accretion on the forereef slopes at Rose is mostly 
CCA rather than corals. In areas of strong wave action, CCA thrives. Note the 
robust coralline algal ridge in the surf zone of the Aua transect, but the meagre 
CCA on unconsolidated rubble on the protected reef flat of the Aua transect. Note 
the prevalence of CCA to greater depths on the windward south coast of Tutuila, 
but the relatively meagre CCA on the north coast. Note corals are often being 
overgrown before they get big on the open coast forereef slopes of Rose, but corals 
are allowed to get big in the lagoon of Rose protected from waves in which CCA is 
mediocre. The strong wave action in combination with the high aragonite 
saturation state (abundantly available carbonate) may allow CCA to usurp the 
otherwise best of all growth conditions from the corals. 
CCA is probably an important positive factor in the extraordinary success of coral 
communities in American Samoa, especially at FBNMS, because CCA enhances 
successful coral recruitment. In American Samoa, coral successful recruits were 
found on CCA 94% of the time (Birkeland et al. 2021).

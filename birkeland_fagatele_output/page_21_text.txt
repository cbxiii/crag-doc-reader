Cyclone Val was a direct hit on NW Tutuila and sat on Tutuila for 5 days with winds up to 240 
km/hr (150 mi/hr) and with some waves 15 m (50 ft) tall. There was also a major bleaching in 
1994. We speculate that the increases in population densities and growths into higher size classes 
from 1995 through 2018 â€“ 2024 were recoveries from low points caused by Cyclone Val, with 
effects perhaps enhanced by the major bleaching in 1994. American Samoan reefs have been hit 
in the past four decades by a second crown-of-thorns outbreak, nine additional cyclones, four 
mass bleaching events, six extreme low tides, and a tsunami which have caused local damages to 
coral communities, but our data have not clearly shown these events to have caused such large-
scale declines and recoveries in population densities and larger size classes as those shown by 
between 1995 and 2018-2024 resulting from Cyclone Val. 
Both coral colony population densities and growth into the larger size classes seem to have 
reached an asymptote of full community recovery in 2018 and 2024 (Figs. 15, 16). Full recovery 
was achieved between our 2002 and 2018 surveys. This means the full recovery of FBNMS 
corals from a serious disturbance takes between 11 and 17 years, i.e., between Cyclone Val in 
1991 and full recovery sometime between 2002 and 2018.

Consistent recruitment 
Steady recruitment may be an important factor explaining the outstanding resilience of American 
Samoan coral communities. At least a hundred coral species on the forereef slopes of American

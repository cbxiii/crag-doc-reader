Abstract – The coral communities in Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary (FBNMS) were 
found in 2018 and 2024 to be in the best condition and most fully developed since 1979. 
Although the coral communities were seriously damaged by an outbreak of Acanthaster planci in 
1978-1979 and Cyclone Val in 1991, the populations of corals in the genus Acropora have 
significantly increased in abundance and size-distribution in FBNMS since 1979 while Acropora 
surveyed around the rest of Tutuila have significantly decreased in abundance. Despite ups and 
downs in population densities of coral colonies from disturbances, the overall regression of coral 
population densities on years from 1985 to 2024 show the coral communities at FBNMS have 
been sustaining themselves well. The slope of the regression of coral population density per year  
is not significantly different from zero (anova on slope, p> 0.79, df 1,158). Porites rus and 
Montipora grisea have also become significantly more abundant in FBNMS as well as on the 
rest of the outer coasts of Tutuila. Since the overall population densities of coral colonies has not

significantly decreased, while Acropora spp., and Montipora grisea have substantially increased, 
some other species must have decreased. The endemic Porites randalli was once the most 
abundant species of coral in FBNMS, but now appears to be gone from FBNMS, the decline 
starting around 2002. Pocillopora and Porites species have been decreasing significantly on the 
outer coasts of Tutuila since 1982, but there has been no overall change in Pocillopora spp. 
population densities in Fagatele Bay since 1985 (p > 0.492). Montipora verrilli was one of the 
more predominant species of  Montipora through 1998, but it crashed to very few in 2002 and 
has not been recorded on our transects for the last 22 years. In contrast, Montipora grisea was 
not recorded at all on our transects before 1995. When it abruptly appeared in 1995, it was 
immediately the most abundant coral with 3379 M. grisea recorded, or 23% of the total number 
of colonies of about 160 other species and has been the most abundant species around Tutuila 
since that initial arrival. Strangely, Pavona varians s.l. and P. chiriquiensis (part of P. varians 
s.l.) together are generally second or third most abundant species around Tutuila, but are almost 
nonexistent in FBNMS. The most remarkable finding is that although the waters in FBNMS have 
a significantly lower carbonate ion availability (measured by aragonite saturation state) than the 
waters of Rose Atoll, and therefore the corals at Rose Atoll should be growing faster, the living 
coral cover and size distributions of coral communities are substantially greater in FBNMS. A 
hypothetical explanation is that the corals at Rose Atoll are growing as fast or faster than in 
FBNMS because of the availability of carbonate ions, but the crustose coralline algae Porolithon 
spp., in combination with consistent wave energy, may respond to high levels of carbonate ion 
availability more than the corals do and are thereby overgrowing the coral colonies before the 
corals can grow to large sizes. Porolithon spp. probably plays major roles in the good 
performance of coral reefs in American Samoa by serving as a good substratum for successful 
recruitment of coral larvae and binding loose or weak substrata for survival of the coral colony as 
it grows. Coral colonies of most species have been found to be increasing in the larger size 
classes and increasing in population density since Cyclone Val in 1991. 
Introduction 
The Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa was established in 1986 by the 
NOAA National Marine Sanctuary System in cooperation with the Government of American 
Samoa’s Division of Marine and Wildlife Resources. Although at 0.25 square miles (0.65 km2), 
FBNMS is the smallest of all NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries, it nevertheless preserves a 
treasure of at least 158 species of reef-building corals (Green et al. 1999; D. Fenner unpublished 
data) which is well over twice the number found in the entire Atlantic Ocean. There are at least 
297 species of reef fishes in FBNMS (Green et al. 1999). 
A year in advance (1985) of the establishment of FBNMS (1986), a baseline survey was done of 
the corals, fishes, macroinvertebrates, and algae. Six permanent location transects perpendicular 
to shore, running from 3 m to 18 m (where possible), were set up at approximately even intervals 
to provide information representing the entire bay (Fig. 1). Perpendicular to the permanent 
location transects, survey transects along which the data were collected were set up at depths of 3 
m, 6 m, 9 m, and 12 m where possible (Fig. 1). The baseline survey in 1985 found the coral 
communities to be recovering from the especially massive Acanthaster planci outbreak of 1978-

1979. Surveys were also done in 1988, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2007, and 2018. This 
report is on the tenth survey in February 2024. 
Although the past four decades have been demanding on the coral communities, the corals of 
Fagatele Bay have been remarkably resilient. In the past four decades there have been two 
outbreaks of corallivorous crown-of-thorns seastars, four mass bleaching events, ten cyclones, 
six extreme low tides, and a tsunami. Furthermore, the island of Tutuila has been sinking five 
times the normal rate since 2010 (Han et al. 2019). Yet the coral communities in FBNMS have 
consistently performed better than those in numerous other sites around Tutuila with greater 
mean living coral cover, greater mean colony sizes, greater species richness in corals, and greater 
mean colony abundance (Green et al. 1999). (This report tells that FBNMS no longer has greater 
mean colony abundances, but the living coral cover is still greater because of the substantially 
greater proportion of colonies in the exponentially greater colony sizes.) The fishes in FBNMS 
have shown greater abundance and species richness per transect in FBNMS than at other 
locations on Tutuila (Green et al. 1999). 
From the nine previous surveys, it had been concluded that the coral communities in the 2018 
survey of Fagatele Bay were in the best condition and development since the coral communities 
were first observed in 1979. When coming to do the surveys in 2024, we were looking forward 
to see if the coral communities in FBNMS were still in such outstanding condition.

Survey transects 30 X 1 m were laid perpendicular to the permanent location transects at 3 m 
depth intervals (3, 6, 9, 12 m) where feasible (Fig. 1). Diameters of all coral colonies whose 
center occurred within the 30 x 1 m were recorded. Fenner usually recorded diameters and 
identifications of corals within 50 cm to the right of the transect and Birkeland usually recorded 
diameters and species to the left 50 cm for the total of 1 m. For each transect, the diameters and 
species were then sorted into seven size classes based on the maximum diameter of the colony;  
< 5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-40 cm, 40-80 cm, 80-160 cm, and >160cm.

Since 1917, the surveys in American Samoa have usually focused on population densities and 
size distributions of coral colonies rather than surface cover in order to better assess what is 
happening. For example, we will show that at least 100 species have been doing well because of 
their abundant recruitment, but we have found only large colonies of three species of Goniopora, 
with no sign of recruitment of Goniopora spp. in our surveys for four decades. This report will 
emphasize the dynamics of the coral communities with population densities and size 
distributions. 
From 1917 through 1973, surveys were done counting coral colonies in quadrats along the 
transects. From 1982 to 1988, we used the point-quarter method, which was precise and super-
informative, but very slow. In 1995, Craig Mundy brought from Australia the method of rapidly 
sorting coral diameters into seven size classes that has been used since. (Birkeland and Fenner 
find it faster to measure diameters and sort them into size classes in the evening after dives. This 
is because Birkeland, at least, finds it too hard and too prone to error to try to remember which 
class is which when rapidly measuring. Nevertheless, it is still much faster than the point-quarter 
method.) 
The reason binning into size classes is better than precise measures is because the extreme range 
of sizes of coral colonies demands as many data as possible. We record colonies from 2 cm to 
22.4 m (Coward et al. 2020), a 1120-fold range of diameters with everything in between. With 
each colony bringing such extreme variance, we need many data, maintaining accuracy, but 
compromising precision. When diameters are translated into surface areas, the 2-cm disk is 3.14 
cm2 while the massive hemisphere is 7,881,627.65 cm2, a 2,510,072.5-fold difference in living 
area. Surveys of most animals do not need to handle such a range of sizes. 
Sorting into seven size categories is a good procedure because it allows us to collect coral survey 
data more rapidly. We found that the coral colonies in Fagatele Bay grew into larger size 
categories more frequently than at Rose Atoll or on the outer coast of Tutuila.  This is much more 
substantial than is indicated by the size-class categories. The size-class categories double at each 
step, but that greatly underrepresents what this means in size (surface area), because surface area 
involves the radius squared.  Each stage increases by the square of a doubled number.  The 
surface area increases with the size category from (in cm2):  4.9   44.2    177    707   2,827    
11,310   (180,956).  
Our calculations involve a gross assumption that all colonies are circular, but this is a reasonable 
method to illustrate the pattern, because the random variations resulting from shape probably 
have smaller effects than the large scale of fixed variation resulting from the squared increase of 
doubled radius. It also involves a gross assumption that the median diameter is a reasonable 
representative of the category size. The colony surface area in Category 7 is in parenthesis 
because it was calculated like the earlier categories, but it actually has no upper boundaries. 
Therefore, I plan to empirically calculate the areas of actual colonies in category 7 individually 
from the raw data.  
Because the difference in coral colony population densities between Fagatele and Rose are 
insignificant, I assumed they are the same. In calculations to illustrate the influence of a few 
corals in the larger size classes towards total living coral cover, I multiplied the percent of the 
corals in each size class times the representative area of each size class.

In this report, we are combining Pavona varians s.l. with P. chiriquiensis data because P. 
chiriquiensis was only recently described (Appendix 1, Taxonomic Notes) and data were not 
distinquished between them in earlier years. They appear to have very similar ecological roles 
and preferred environmental conditions. We will combine them under the name Pavona varians 
s.l. The “s.l.” stands for “sensu lato” which means Pavona varians “in the broad sense”. 
                                                                        Results 
Population densities of coral colonies 
It is surprising that overall, despite the severe cyclones, bleaching, crown-of-thorns outbreaks, 
and other events that have caused major damages to many coral communities on time-scales of 
years approaching decades, the abundances or population densities of all coral colonies has not 
changed significantly overall (Fig. 2A) during the years between 1982 and 2024 (42 years) for all 
the sites around Tutuila and Aunu’u (19 sites after excluding Pago Pago Harbor and FBNMS). 
The same can be said for the coral communities along the six sets of permanent transects in 
Fagatele Bay (Fig. 2B). Although the total abundance or population density of all species of coral 
colonies for all sites has not changed, the changes in size distributions and the reassortment of 
relative abundances of coral genera and species have produced important changes in community 
structure of corals over these 42 years. 
It was also a surprise to find the average population densities of coral colonies on the open coast 
of Tutuila (12.8 ± 8.28 colonies m-2) to be significantly greater (p < 0.05, t-test df 351) than the 
population densities of coral colonies in FBNMS (11.0 colonies ± 7.42 m-2). The coral colony 
population densities on Rose Atoll (12.5 ± 8.35 colonies m-2) were also larger than in FBNMS 
(11.0 colonies m-2), but not significantly (p = 0.13, t-test df 199). The mean densities and 
standard deviations of outer coast Tutuila and Rose Atoll are so similar, that it is unbelievable 
that one was significantly different from Fagatele Bay and the other was not. We carefully 
repeated the analysis, but the same results continue to be found. Calculations of living coral 
cover based on proportions of colonies among size distributions (explained in Methods section) 
at Fagatele Bay, Rose Atoll, and the open coast Tutuila indicate that living coral cover is greater 
in FBNMS because of the size distributions of coral colonies, even though the population 
densities are greater at Tutuila and Rose. 
Caveat --- It may also be the case that we record lower population densities of coral colonies in 
Fagatele Bay because it is impractical to try to count individual colonies in larger stands of 
branching corals such as Acropora intermedia (Fig.16) so we recorded large continuous stands as 
a s a single colony, whereas smaller digitate colonies typical of outer Tutuila and Rose Atoll are 
easily recorded separately. Nevertheless, there is substantially more living coral cover in 
Fagatele, which needs to be explained.

data from a transect, not just a coral colony. 
Prevalence of coral recruits 
One aspect of coral population dynamics that may be a key factor in the success of American 
Samoan corals during the Anthropocene is the prevalence and continuity of coral recruitment. 
About a hundred of the species found in our transects on the forereefs of the American Samoan 
Archipelago have recruits (defined as corals < 5 cm diameter) representing a substantial portion 
of their size distributions (Appendix 2). Combining the diameters of all species on all transects at 
all sites for all years, the recruits made up 23.60% of the combined size distributions (Fig. 3).

Reassortment of coral species and genera over four decades 
Acropora is probably the genus of reef-building coral most influential to the topographic 
complexity of the reef which provides shelter for reef fishes. From 1985 to 2024, the population 
density of Acropora spp. increased significantly in FBNMS (Fig. 4A), while the population 
densities of Acropora at other sites on the open coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u (not including Pago 
Pago Harbor and FBNMS) from 1982 to 1985 decreased significantly (Fig. 4B). Although 
neither FBNMS and the outer coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u have changed overall in coral 
population density during the past four decades, the increased prevalence of large, branching 
Acropora (especially A. intermedia) has made FBNMS appear to have changed for the better in 
coral community structure while a large part of the rest of the open coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u 
may seem to have declined.  
More important than increasing population density, Acropora grew into the larger size-class 
colonies which increased their living-coral cover exponentially (see Methods and Discussion) in 
contrast to Acropora on the outer coast of Tutuila, Rose, and Ta’u (Fig. 5). This raises the 
question about why Acropora does much better at FBNMS than on Rose Atoll, Ta’u, and the rest 
of Tutuila.  
We had a strong impression that the corals in Fagatele Bay, especially Acropora, were in the 
greatest state ever in 2024, but the data actually show that the increase in population density and 
size distribution of Acropora may have reached an asymptote just before 2018. If we compare

remarkably similar. Likewise, although the regression of population density of Acropora colonies 
significantly increases as the years continue, the final two years look as though they could be

skeletal growth in Fagatele Bay. Acropora grows into larger size classes than in most other 
places in American Samoa. At Ta’u and at Rose Atoll, Acropora recruits well and apparently 
does well while still small colonies, but generally fails to grow to larger colony sizes. There may

be some larger Acropora on Ta’u, but they did not show up in our surveys at Afuli, Faga, 
Fagamalo Cove, and Lepula. 
A widespread major change in the coral communities of American Samoa since the early 1980s 
is the significant increase in Porites rus, both in Fagatele Bay and on the outer coasts of Tutuila 
(Fig. 6). This year (2024), P. rus made 324/2380, or 13.6 % of the corals in Fagatele Bay. As 
with Acropora, P. rus increased in upper size classes in Fagatele Bay, but P. rus also increased in 
upper size classes on the outer coast of Tutuila (Fig. 7).  Combining increases in abundances with 
increases in size distributions, Porites rus is making the most substantial increases over the years 
in many places. 
Porites rus and Pavona varians s.l. are among the most abundant species around Tutuila and 
they have been increasing further in recent years (Appendix 4 – Ranking of species by 
abundance in 1995, 2002, and 2018). In 2018, after Montipora grisea (nearly always the most 
abundant coral since it first appeared in 1995), the second most common was Pavona varians s.l. 
and third was Porites rus (Appendix 4).  
However, Fagatele Bay is an exception for Pavona varians s.l. Pavona varians s.l. did the 
opposite of Acropora species. Pavona varians s.l. has been significantly increasing in relative 
abundance on the outer coast of Tutuila since 1982 (Fig. 8B), but P. varians s.l. has been 
perpetually so rare in Fagatele that Excel would not do a regression (Fig. 8A).  This year in 
Fagatele, P. varians (11) and P. chiriquiensis (17) together made 28/2380, or 1.2 % of the coral in 
Fagatele Bay.  Since most species do better in Fagatele than elsewhere, why does P. varians s.l. 
do so well everywhere except Fagatele? Why was it the second most common among hundreds 
of species around Tutuila in 2018, but nearly absent from Fagatele?

Fagatele Bay where it has been consistently very rare (Fig. 8A). Fig. 8 B shows an abrupt drop in 
2024, but of course that is because we only surveyed Fagatele this year. Each of the dots 
represents data from a transect, not just a coral colony. 
Two more striking changes in coral communities on Tutuila over the past 44 years involve 
Montipora species.  Montipora verrilli was one of the more prevalent Montipora through 1998, 
but it crashed to very few in 2002 and has not been recorded on our transects for the last 22 years 
(Fig. 9). In contrast, Montipora grisea was not recorded at all on our transects before 1995. Of 
the 6,416 corals recorded in 1982, 1985, and 1988, none were M. grisea. When it abruptly 
appeared in 1995, it was immediately the most abundant coral with 3379 M. grisea recorded, or 
23% of the total number of colonies of about 160 other species (Fig. 9).  Questions as to the 
taxonomy of these two species of Montipora are explained in Taxonomic Notes, Appendix 1.

All encrusting Montipora other than M. verrilli and M. grisea taken together have not shown an 
overall change from 1985 to 2024 in Fagatele Bay (Fig. 10A), but there has been a significant 
increase in abundance from 1982 to 2018 on the outer coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u (Fig. 10 B).

Montipora grisea was not seen until 1995 when it was instantly most abundant species. It has 
remained the most abundant species since 1995. Although the regression appears to have an 
increasing slope through the years, but it was not significant (p = 0.059, df 1,107). Each of the 
dots represents data from a transect, not just a coral colony.

(Fig. 10A), there was no overall change in population density between 1985 and 1024 (p = 0.232, 
df 1,143), but there has been a significant increase in population density of encrusting Montipora 
on the outer coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u between 1982 and 2018 (p , 0.001, df 1,367). Each of 
the dots represents data from a transect, not just a coral colony. 
Pocillopora species have also been decreasing significantly on the outer coasts of Tutuila since 
1982 (Fig. 11, p < 0.001, df 1, 551), but there has been no overall change in Pocillopora spp. 
population densities in Fagatele Bay since 1985 (Fig. 11 p > 0.492 df 1, 154). No change is 
actually another positive score for Fagatele Bay because it is in contrast to the significant 
declines elsewhere.

Large colonies of massive Porites have been maintaining themselves over the decades (Coward 
et al. 2020), but the more common colonies in the smaller size classes have been significantly 
declining in abundance, both in Fagatele Bay (Fig. 12A) and on the outer coast of Tutuila and 
Aunu’u (Fig. 12 B, not including Pago Pago Harbor and Fagatele Bay). Mound-shaped Porites 
species recruit better on Tutuila (including Fagatele Bay), Aunu’u, and Ofu-Olosenga, than at 
Ta’u, but tend to survive longer and reach the larger size classes on Ta’u (this paper Fig. 13;

better than on other islands, but they tend to last longer and grow to larger sizes. This 
corroborates Coward et al. 2020. 
The most spectacular long-term change in the coral communities in American Samoa 1982 – 
2024 has been the history of the endemic Porites randalli.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the survey 
reports showed it sometimes to be the most abundant coral in Fagatele Bay, Fatumafuti, 
Faga’alu, Fagaitua, and Masefau, and a close second to Montipora grisea at Vatia and Aunu’u. 
McArdle, in his 2003 review of American Samoa coral surveys, called it the most ubiquitous 
species, uniformly distributed among the depths surveyed (1 m – 12 m). The regression in Fig. 
14 shows the extreme drop in P. randalli abundance starting about the year 2000. Note that the 
regression has its abundance below zero in 2024 and, indeed, we saw no P. randalli in the 
February 2024 survey. However, we saw 12 P. randalli-like encrusing colonies for the first time 
in 2024.The small dots over the zero line in 2024 represent the P. randalli-like encrusting 
colonies in Fagatele Bay. 
Another measure of the drastic decline in endemic P. randalli over the decades is the ranking of 
coral species abundances through the years (Appendix 4).  In 1995, Montipora grisea was in top 
place with 3379 recorded colonies. (Montipora grisea has remained the most prevalent ever 
since.) In 1995, P. randalli was second place with 2635 recorded colonies. Pavona varians s.l. 
was a distant third place with 745 colonies. Then in 2002, P. randalli was 56th place with 33 
colonies and in 2018 52nd place with 21 colonies recorded. Then in 2024, it was not ranked 
because we recorded zero colonies P. randalli. It is probably still doing fine in the Ofu pools and 
other shallow places, but it is no longer ubiquitous at all sites at all depths (to at least 12 m).

DISCUSSION 
 Abundances of coral colonies 
If it is indeed the case that since the 1950s, the global coverage of living coral cover has declined 
by about 50% and the global capacity of coral reefs to provide ecosystem services has also 
declined by 50% (Eddy et al. 2021), the coral reefs of American Samoa, especially in Fagatele 
Bay National Marine Sanctuary, are showing outstanding performances. Despite the major 
mortalities of coral colonies from crown-of-thorns seastar outbreaks, severe widespread 
destruction of coral colonies by cyclones, and the stress brought by bleaching events, the 
recoveries have been consistent and there has been no overall significant change in average 
population densities between 1982 and 2018 on the outer coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u (19 sites, 
not including Pago Pago Harbor and Fagatele Bay) and between 1985 and 2024 in the FBNMS.  
Full recovery of coral communities in Fagatele Bay 
The two main events affecting the coral reefs of Tutuila and Aunu’u in the past four decades have 
been the 1978-1979 outbreak of crown-of-thorns seastars and the 1991 Cyclone Val. Acropora 
spp. in FBNMS, Pavona varians s.l., Pavona chiriquiensis, and Montipora spp. (not including 
M. verrilli and M. grisea) everywhere except in FBNMS, and Porites rus and Montipora grisea 
everywhere including FBNMS significantly increased in population densities from low in 
population densities found in surveys in1995. Further, the size distributions of the majority of 
coral species in 1995 surveys were in lower size classes, but the species grew into the larger size 
class from 1995 to sometime between 2002 and 2018.  


================================================================================

Cyclone Val was a direct hit on NW Tutuila and sat on Tutuila for 5 days with winds up to 240 
km/hr (150 mi/hr) and with some waves 15 m (50 ft) tall. There was also a major bleaching in 
1994. We speculate that the increases in population densities and growths into higher size classes 
from 1995 through 2018 – 2024 were recoveries from low points caused by Cyclone Val, with 
effects perhaps enhanced by the major bleaching in 1994. American Samoan reefs have been hit 
in the past four decades by a second crown-of-thorns outbreak, nine additional cyclones, four 
mass bleaching events, six extreme low tides, and a tsunami which have caused local damages to 
coral communities, but our data have not clearly shown these events to have caused such large-
scale declines and recoveries in population densities and larger size classes as those shown by 
between 1995 and 2018-2024 resulting from Cyclone Val. 
Both coral colony population densities and growth into the larger size classes seem to have 
reached an asymptote of full community recovery in 2018 and 2024 (Figs. 15, 16). Full recovery 
was achieved between our 2002 and 2018 surveys. This means the full recovery of FBNMS 
corals from a serious disturbance takes between 11 and 17 years, i.e., between Cyclone Val in 
1991 and full recovery sometime between 2002 and 2018.

Consistent recruitment 
Steady recruitment may be an important factor explaining the outstanding resilience of American 
Samoan coral communities. At least a hundred coral species on the forereef slopes of American

Samoan reefs have good recruitment (Appendix 2). Of all coral colony diameters we have 
measured (34,883), 23.60 % were < 5 cm. Good recruitment is a sign that the species is not 
seriously affected by Allee effects. It also is a sign that the species population is not seriously 
stressed by temperature or other factors because when stressed, most corals divert energy from 
reproduction to survival (Birkeland 2015). When recovering from bleaching, some corals can go 
for four years before spawning (Levitan et al. 2014).  Corals in the same area that did not bleach 
can also go for four years before spawning because they also endured the stress even though they 
were able to avoid bleaching (Levitan et a. 2014).  Recruitment is a sign that at least some of the 
species population was in areas where it was not stressed. While species at the top of the 
recruitment list are shown to be doing well, this does not imply that those lower in the list are 
affected by Allee effects or are stressed. We only surveyed the forereef slopes. Those lower on 
the recruitment list may be doing well in other habitats.  
Trajectories over four decades 
Although the total coral colony population density of all species combined over all sites and all 
years has not changed when considering the entire four decades (Fig. 2), there have been major 
changes in species composition during this time. Although corals of individual species or genera 
have had their ups and downs, perhaps several times each, there are a number of these species 
that have had a significant increase or decrease over the entire four decades. This is what we are 
calling “trajectories”. According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a “trajectory” is a straight 
line or path, or a line or path with a constant angle. The antonym of “trajectory” is “deviation”. 
Deviations in coral colony abundances over shorter time intervals within our four decades may 
be called “decreases” and “disturbances” or “increases” and “recoveries”. Trajectories are a 
rather abstract concept of an overall significant change (or significant lack of change) over 
decades. 
Coral-reef scientists who started their careers after the 1970s grew up familiar with climate 
change and long-term broad-scale changes in coral-reef systems and so they are familiar with 
trajectories, but those starting their careers in the 1970s and earlier perceived events and changes 
in coral-reef systems as cyclic, e.g., disturbance and recovery, El Niño – La Niña, seasons, etc. 
Those starting by the 1970s understand trajectories, but are uncomfortable with them, feeling the 
systems should be fluctuating about some “normal” state, rather than continuing long-term 
changes to a new state for decades, perhaps permanently in our scale of reference. 
The average population densities of coral colonies were about 12-13 per m2 from 1982 – 2018 on 
the outer coast of Tutuila and 11 per m2 from 1985 – 2024 in FBNMS.  Within this general 
population density over these four decades, there have been some trajectories, or overall changes 
over these four decades.  
Acropora spp. increased over these four decades in FBNMS, but decreased on the outer coasts of 
Tutuila and Aunu’u. This is probably the change that leads people to believe the coral 
communities in FBNMS from 2018 to 2024 have been in the best condition since 1979. Porites 
rus and Montipora grisea have increased on both the outer coast of Tutuila and FBNMS. 


================================================================================
PAGE 23 (digital_extraction)
================================================================================

 
23 
 
Observations by one of us on Guam and Maui and conversations with colleagues from around 
the tropical Pacific suggest that Porites rus is increasing in many sites in the tropical Pacific. 
The encrusting Montipora spp. (other than M. verrilli and M. grisea) and Pocillopora spp. did 
not change significantly over the four decades in Fagatele Bay. This is another kudo for FBNMS, 
because Pocillopora has significantly declined in areas other than Fagatele Bay. 
On the other hand, Pavona varians s.l. has been increasing significantly (p < 0.001 df 1,551) on 
most sites outside Fagalete Bay, but P.  varians s.l. has been almost nonexistent in Fagatele Bay 
since 1985. 
Since the total coral colony population density at FBNMS has remained the same across the four 
decades, then the significant increases in Acropora spp., Porites rus, and Montipora grisea 
suggests there must have been substantially decreased population densities of some other 
species. Although the larger colonies of massive Porites are persisting, the population density of 
mound-shaped Porites spp. have bee significantly decreasing both on the outer coast of Tutuila 
and in FBNMS. The endemic Porites randalli has showed the most drastic decrease since 1996 
(Fig. 14). Up until 1996, it was first or second (to M. grisea) most abundant and ubiquitous 
(McArdle 2003) of all coral species in American Samoa. Although it has practically disappeared 
from the forereef slope, it still seems to be doing fine in other habitats such as reef-flat pools. 
Paradox of Rose Atoll corals compared to corals in Fagatele Bay 
We have been confronted with the question as to why Acropora grow into the substantially larger 
size classes in Fagatele Bay, but not at Ta’u and Rose Atoll (Fig. 5). It has been suggested that 
wave energy may affect coral colonies that have a lot of branches or wave-resistant surface area 
attached to the substratum by a smaller stalk or trunk. Both Ta’u and Rose Atoll drop off steeply 
from shore and are frequently exposed directly to strong surf. The stronger trade winds come 
from the east-southeast (PIFSC-CRED data provided in Aeby et al. 2008). Brian Peck suggested 
that heavy wave action on the open coasts of Rose Atoll prevent branching genera such as 
Acropora from getting large. This same suggestion was previously given independently by Alice 
Lawrence for the Acropora colonies staying small at Ta’u. Tutuila has a broader, shallower shelf 
than do Ta’u and Rose and also has offshore banks such as Taema that help reduce the energy of 
oceanic waves. Fagatele Bay is an exception on Tutuila because the shelf drops steeply off 
Fagatele. However, Fagatele is relatively protected from waves from the southeast by Larsen Bay 
and Steps Point. Ironically, our February 2024 survey has hindered by strong swells from the 
west; but these were swells, not surf, which tossed the scientists around, but did not break 
corals.. 
It is possible that frequent strong waves limit the sizes of branching corals (Figs. 5, 17), but the 
massive or mound-shaped Porites tend to grow into the larger size classes (Fig. 13 and 18 this 
paper; Coward et al. 2020). It may be that massive coral colonies with a broad attachment at their 
bases and with rounded hemispherical morphologies are less vulnerable to waves than branching 
corals. Therefore, wave action may be a plausible explanation of Ta’u where Acropora are

Fig. 18. Alice Lawrence expresses approval that despite the significant declines in population 
densities of mound-shaped species of Porites in Fagatele Bay (Fig. 12A) and around the open 
coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u (Fig. 12B), the massive Porites in Fagatele Bay, including one that 
was dynamited by fishers decades ago, are still doing fine.  However, note the background 
dominance of Acropora.                                                                            (Photo by Alison Green) 
restricted in size while massive Porites can grow large. But how do we explain the open coast of 
Rose Atoll where Porites and other massive hemispherical corals also do not grow large? 
This question is exacerbated by the fact that local seawater chemistry suggests we should expect 
the corals to actually grow larger and produce more living coral cover on Rose Atoll than in 
Fagatele Bay. Waters around Rose Atoll may have the highest aragonite saturation state in US 
territories (NOAA CRED 2016), which is a measure of the availability of carbonate ion, which in 
turn determines that carbonate accretion rate should be highest at Rose Atoll. Carbonate 
accretion rate is indeed greatest in American Samoa at Rose Atoll and much less at Tutuila 
(NOAA CRED 2016), yet corals appear to grow less at Rose and much better at Fagatele (Fig. 5) 
and produce significantly more living coral cover at Fagatele Bay (Fig. 19).  The greater 
carbonate accretion at Rose Atoll may be by organisms other than corals, perhaps by CCA. It is 
also possible that corals are accreting carbonate skeletons as fast or faster than at Fagatele Bay,

but mortality from wave action and/or overgrowth by CCA increases turnover so although the 
corals are growing more rapidly, their size distribution stays concentrated in the smaller size 
classes.  
 
Fig. 19. The 2016 survey by NOAA CRED found that despite substantially greater rates of 
carbonate accretion (from greater carbonate ion availability as measured by aragonite saturation 
state 4.034 ±0.014) and therefore potential for reef-building, the living coral cover on the 
forereef slope at Rose Atoll (far right bar) was significantly less than living coral cover at 
Fagatele Bay (third bar from right) which had significantly less (anova p< 0.001, df 1,54) 
aragonite saturation state (3.818 ±0.022) or potential for reef-building. (Data on aragonite 
saturation state and anova from Vargas – Ángel et al. 2019). 
Since the aragonite saturation state (CaCO3 accretion or reef-building potential) is significantly 
greater on Rose Atoll than at Tutuila, the recruitment of corals is good and lower size classes are 
doing well and population densities are as good as anywhere in our surveys (Fig. 5). It seems like 
the population is robust, with rapid turnover. The high levels of aragonite saturation state are 
good for coral growth, but perhaps even better for CCA. Although CCA sometimes overgrows 
Acropora in Fagatele, corals are still dominant in Fagatele. What makes Rose Atoll almost 
unique in the dominance of CCA over corals (Fig. 20)? Perhaps Rose Atoll has a special 
combination of carbonic ion availability (as indicated by aragonite saturation state) and strong 
wave action.  
Field observations suggest that the increased carbonate accretion is done more by CCA and with 
a greater reaction to carbonate ion availability than by corals. Therefore, the corals are losing in 
competition (Fig. 20), even though the aragonite saturation state, and perhaps their growth rates, 
are especially high.

Fig. 20. Field observations suggest that CCA (mostly Porolithon craspedium and Porolithon 
onkodes s.l.) react more strongly than corals to increased available carbonate ions (as measured 
by aragonite saturation state) and are thereby overgrowing corals, reducing the chances of corals 
to grow into the larger size classes. 
It could be that the carbonate accretion on the forereef slopes at Rose is mostly 
CCA rather than corals. In areas of strong wave action, CCA thrives. Note the 
robust coralline algal ridge in the surf zone of the Aua transect, but the meagre 
CCA on unconsolidated rubble on the protected reef flat of the Aua transect. Note 
the prevalence of CCA to greater depths on the windward south coast of Tutuila, 
but the relatively meagre CCA on the north coast. Note corals are often being 
overgrown before they get big on the open coast forereef slopes of Rose, but corals 
are allowed to get big in the lagoon of Rose protected from waves in which CCA is 
mediocre. The strong wave action in combination with the high aragonite 
saturation state (abundantly available carbonate) may allow CCA to usurp the 
otherwise best of all growth conditions from the corals. 
CCA is probably an important positive factor in the extraordinary success of coral 
communities in American Samoa, especially at FBNMS, because CCA enhances 
successful coral recruitment. In American Samoa, coral successful recruits were 
found on CCA 94% of the time (Birkeland et al. 2021).

What evidence shows FBNMS coral communities to have outstanding 
performance? 
In contrast to most of the reef-building coral communities around the world (Eddy 
et al. 2021), the coral colony population densities in FBNMS over the past four 
decades have remained at the same level, despite major mortalities of corals from 
crown-of-thorns outbreaks, major cyclones, and the stress brought about by 
bleaching events.  
The coral communities in FBNMS fully recovered from Cyclone Val within 11 – 
17 years. 
The Coralline Lethal Orange Disease (CLOD) has been seen on CCA nearly every 
dive in Fagatele Bay for over 20 years, but the CCA has kept it under control. This 
may change if seawater temperatures increase, but the CCA in Fagatele Bay are not 
succumbing yet. 
Acropora spp. significantly increased in population density and grew into larger 
size categories in FBNMS, but significantly decreased in population density and 
showed almost no growth into larger size categories on the outer coat of Tutuila 
and Aunu’u.

APPENDIX 1 – Taxonomic Notes   
Pavona varians are combined with P. chiriquiensis in this report because they were not usually 
distinguished in the early surveys and so we cannot reliably sort them out among data from 
earlier years. Dick Randall always recognized them as different species. He called P. 
chiriquiensis “Pavona collines”.  “Collines” are little hills.  The species was not officially 
described until 2001 when it was described from Panamá by Glynn, Maté. And Stemann (2001). 
We have no worries when combining their analysis because they seem to have the same 
ecological roles and they are both common. 
That Montipora verrilli was abundant, but completely disappeared after 2002, while M. grisea 
suddenly appeared in full abundance in 1995 might suggest that since encrusting Montipora 
species are usually hard to tell apart, this may all be a result of confused identification. However, 
both Dick Randall and Craig Mundy independently distinguished and recoded both M. verrilli 
and M. grisea between 1995 and 2002. Both species are common on Guam, and Dick Randall 
includes them both on his publications on corals of the Marianas. I believe the late Dick Randall 
knew these species well, and if he did not see M. grisea before 1995, then it was not there or it

was too rare to be recorded before 1995. From my less expert view, the surface of M. verrilli is 
largely relatively orderly cobblestones while the surface of M. grisea is more chaotic and rough.

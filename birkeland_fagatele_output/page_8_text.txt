Reassortment of coral species and genera over four decades 
Acropora is probably the genus of reef-building coral most influential to the topographic 
complexity of the reef which provides shelter for reef fishes. From 1985 to 2024, the population 
density of Acropora spp. increased significantly in FBNMS (Fig. 4A), while the population 
densities of Acropora at other sites on the open coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u (not including Pago 
Pago Harbor and FBNMS) from 1982 to 1985 decreased significantly (Fig. 4B). Although 
neither FBNMS and the outer coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u have changed overall in coral 
population density during the past four decades, the increased prevalence of large, branching 
Acropora (especially A. intermedia) has made FBNMS appear to have changed for the better in 
coral community structure while a large part of the rest of the open coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u 
may seem to have declined.  
More important than increasing population density, Acropora grew into the larger size-class 
colonies which increased their living-coral cover exponentially (see Methods and Discussion) in 
contrast to Acropora on the outer coast of Tutuila, Rose, and Ta’u (Fig. 5). This raises the 
question about why Acropora does much better at FBNMS than on Rose Atoll, Ta’u, and the rest 
of Tutuila.  
We had a strong impression that the corals in Fagatele Bay, especially Acropora, were in the 
greatest state ever in 2024, but the data actually show that the increase in population density and 
size distribution of Acropora may have reached an asymptote just before 2018. If we compare

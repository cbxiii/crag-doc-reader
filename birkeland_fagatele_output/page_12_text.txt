Fig. 6. Porites rus has significantly increased in population densities since the 1980s, both in 
Fagatele Bay (Fig. 6A, p < 0.001 df 1,154) and other sites on the open coast of Tutuila and 
Aunuâ€™u (Fig. 6B, p< 0.001 df 1,188). Each of the dots represents data from a transect, not just a 
coral colony.

Fig. 18. Alice Lawrence expresses approval that despite the significant declines in population 
densities of mound-shaped species of Porites in Fagatele Bay (Fig. 12A) and around the open 
coast of Tutuila and Aunuâ€™u (Fig. 12B), the massive Porites in Fagatele Bay, including one that 
was dynamited by fishers decades ago, are still doing fine.  However, note the background 
dominance of Acropora.                                                                            (Photo by Alison Green) 
restricted in size while massive Porites can grow large. But how do we explain the open coast of 
Rose Atoll where Porites and other massive hemispherical corals also do not grow large? 
This question is exacerbated by the fact that local seawater chemistry suggests we should expect 
the corals to actually grow larger and produce more living coral cover on Rose Atoll than in 
Fagatele Bay. Waters around Rose Atoll may have the highest aragonite saturation state in US 
territories (NOAA CRED 2016), which is a measure of the availability of carbonate ion, which in 
turn determines that carbonate accretion rate should be highest at Rose Atoll. Carbonate 
accretion rate is indeed greatest in American Samoa at Rose Atoll and much less at Tutuila 
(NOAA CRED 2016), yet corals appear to grow less at Rose and much better at Fagatele (Fig. 5) 
and produce significantly more living coral cover at Fagatele Bay (Fig. 19).  The greater 
carbonate accretion at Rose Atoll may be by organisms other than corals, perhaps by CCA. It is 
also possible that corals are accreting carbonate skeletons as fast or faster than at Fagatele Bay,

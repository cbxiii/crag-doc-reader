Abstract â€“ The coral communities in Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary (FBNMS) were 
found in 2018 and 2024 to be in the best condition and most fully developed since 1979. 
Although the coral communities were seriously damaged by an outbreak of Acanthaster planci in 
1978-1979 and Cyclone Val in 1991, the populations of corals in the genus Acropora have 
significantly increased in abundance and size-distribution in FBNMS since 1979 while Acropora 
surveyed around the rest of Tutuila have significantly decreased in abundance. Despite ups and 
downs in population densities of coral colonies from disturbances, the overall regression of coral 
population densities on years from 1985 to 2024 show the coral communities at FBNMS have 
been sustaining themselves well. The slope of the regression of coral population density per year  
is not significantly different from zero (anova on slope, p> 0.79, df 1,158). Porites rus and 
Montipora grisea have also become significantly more abundant in FBNMS as well as on the 
rest of the outer coasts of Tutuila. Since the overall population densities of coral colonies has not

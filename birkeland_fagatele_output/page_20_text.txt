Fig. 14. Porites randalli for all sites and years. The probability that the negative slope of the 
regression equals zero is p < 0.001 df 1, 551. Each of the dots represents data from a transect, not 
just a coral colony. 
DISCUSSION 
 Abundances of coral colonies 
If it is indeed the case that since the 1950s, the global coverage of living coral cover has declined 
by about 50% and the global capacity of coral reefs to provide ecosystem services has also 
declined by 50% (Eddy et al. 2021), the coral reefs of American Samoa, especially in Fagatele 
Bay National Marine Sanctuary, are showing outstanding performances. Despite the major 
mortalities of coral colonies from crown-of-thorns seastar outbreaks, severe widespread 
destruction of coral colonies by cyclones, and the stress brought by bleaching events, the 
recoveries have been consistent and there has been no overall significant change in average 
population densities between 1982 and 2018 on the outer coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u (19 sites, 
not including Pago Pago Harbor and Fagatele Bay) and between 1985 and 2024 in the FBNMS.  
Full recovery of coral communities in Fagatele Bay 
The two main events affecting the coral reefs of Tutuila and Aunu’u in the past four decades have 
been the 1978-1979 outbreak of crown-of-thorns seastars and the 1991 Cyclone Val. Acropora 
spp. in FBNMS, Pavona varians s.l., Pavona chiriquiensis, and Montipora spp. (not including 
M. verrilli and M. grisea) everywhere except in FBNMS, and Porites rus and Montipora grisea 
everywhere including FBNMS significantly increased in population densities from low in 
population densities found in surveys in1995. Further, the size distributions of the majority of 
coral species in 1995 surveys were in lower size classes, but the species grew into the larger size 
class from 1995 to sometime between 2002 and 2018.

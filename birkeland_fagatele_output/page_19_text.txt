Fig. 13. Size distributions of mound Porites. On Ta’u, Porites mound-species do not recruit 
better than on other islands, but they tend to last longer and grow to larger sizes. This 
corroborates Coward et al. 2020. 
The most spectacular long-term change in the coral communities in American Samoa 1982 – 
2024 has been the history of the endemic Porites randalli.  In the 1980s and 1990s, the survey 
reports showed it sometimes to be the most abundant coral in Fagatele Bay, Fatumafuti, 
Faga’alu, Fagaitua, and Masefau, and a close second to Montipora grisea at Vatia and Aunu’u. 
McArdle, in his 2003 review of American Samoa coral surveys, called it the most ubiquitous 
species, uniformly distributed among the depths surveyed (1 m – 12 m). The regression in Fig. 
14 shows the extreme drop in P. randalli abundance starting about the year 2000. Note that the 
regression has its abundance below zero in 2024 and, indeed, we saw no P. randalli in the 
February 2024 survey. However, we saw 12 P. randalli-like encrusing colonies for the first time 
in 2024.The small dots over the zero line in 2024 represent the P. randalli-like encrusting 
colonies in Fagatele Bay. 
Another measure of the drastic decline in endemic P. randalli over the decades is the ranking of 
coral species abundances through the years (Appendix 4).  In 1995, Montipora grisea was in top 
place with 3379 recorded colonies. (Montipora grisea has remained the most prevalent ever 
since.) In 1995, P. randalli was second place with 2635 recorded colonies. Pavona varians s.l. 
was a distant third place with 745 colonies. Then in 2002, P. randalli was 56th place with 33 
colonies and in 2018 52nd place with 21 colonies recorded. Then in 2024, it was not ranked 
because we recorded zero colonies P. randalli. It is probably still doing fine in the Ofu pools and 
other shallow places, but it is no longer ubiquitous at all sites at all depths (to at least 12 m).

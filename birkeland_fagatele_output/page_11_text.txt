be some larger Acropora on Ta’u, but they did not show up in our surveys at Afuli, Faga, 
Fagamalo Cove, and Lepula. 
A widespread major change in the coral communities of American Samoa since the early 1980s 
is the significant increase in Porites rus, both in Fagatele Bay and on the outer coasts of Tutuila 
(Fig. 6). This year (2024), P. rus made 324/2380, or 13.6 % of the corals in Fagatele Bay. As 
with Acropora, P. rus increased in upper size classes in Fagatele Bay, but P. rus also increased in 
upper size classes on the outer coast of Tutuila (Fig. 7).  Combining increases in abundances with 
increases in size distributions, Porites rus is making the most substantial increases over the years 
in many places. 
Porites rus and Pavona varians s.l. are among the most abundant species around Tutuila and 
they have been increasing further in recent years (Appendix 4 – Ranking of species by 
abundance in 1995, 2002, and 2018). In 2018, after Montipora grisea (nearly always the most 
abundant coral since it first appeared in 1995), the second most common was Pavona varians s.l. 
and third was Porites rus (Appendix 4).  
However, Fagatele Bay is an exception for Pavona varians s.l. Pavona varians s.l. did the 
opposite of Acropora species. Pavona varians s.l. has been significantly increasing in relative 
abundance on the outer coast of Tutuila since 1982 (Fig. 8B), but P. varians s.l. has been 
perpetually so rare in Fagatele that Excel would not do a regression (Fig. 8A).  This year in 
Fagatele, P. varians (11) and P. chiriquiensis (17) together made 28/2380, or 1.2 % of the coral in 
Fagatele Bay.  Since most species do better in Fagatele than elsewhere, why does P. varians s.l. 
do so well everywhere except Fagatele? Why was it the second most common among hundreds 
of species around Tutuila in 2018, but nearly absent from Fagatele?

1979. Surveys were also done in 1988, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2007, and 2018. This 
report is on the tenth survey in February 2024. 
Although the past four decades have been demanding on the coral communities, the corals of 
Fagatele Bay have been remarkably resilient. In the past four decades there have been two 
outbreaks of corallivorous crown-of-thorns seastars, four mass bleaching events, ten cyclones, 
six extreme low tides, and a tsunami. Furthermore, the island of Tutuila has been sinking five 
times the normal rate since 2010 (Han et al. 2019). Yet the coral communities in FBNMS have 
consistently performed better than those in numerous other sites around Tutuila with greater 
mean living coral cover, greater mean colony sizes, greater species richness in corals, and greater 
mean colony abundance (Green et al. 1999). (This report tells that FBNMS no longer has greater 
mean colony abundances, but the living coral cover is still greater because of the substantially 
greater proportion of colonies in the exponentially greater colony sizes.) The fishes in FBNMS 
have shown greater abundance and species richness per transect in FBNMS than at other 
locations on Tutuila (Green et al. 1999). 
From the nine previous surveys, it had been concluded that the coral communities in the 2018 
survey of Fagatele Bay were in the best condition and development since the coral communities 
were first observed in 1979. When coming to do the surveys in 2024, we were looking forward 
to see if the coral communities in FBNMS were still in such outstanding condition.

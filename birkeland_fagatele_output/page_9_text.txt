Fig. 4. The population densities of Acropora spp. in American Samoa through four decades. A --- 
Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The probability that the slope of the regression of 
population density of Acropora spp. over the years 1985 – 2024 is zero and not positive (anova 
on the slope) is p < 0.001 (df 1,154). B --- Open coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u, excluding Pago 
Pago Harbor and Fagatele Bay. The probability that the slope of the regression of population 
density of Acropora spp. over the years 1982 – 2018 is zero and not negative is p < 0.001 (df 1, 
194).  Each dot is a total from a transect, not an individual colony.  
the size distributions of Acropora in in 2018 and 2024 (Appendix 3), we find they are 
remarkably similar. Likewise, although the regression of population density of Acropora colonies 
significantly increases as the years continue, the final two years look as though they could be

Fig. 2. The population densities of coral colonies in American Samoa through four decades, 
combining all coral species. A --- Open coast of Tutuila and Aunu’u, excluding Pago Pago 
Harbor and Fagatele Bay. The probability that the slope of the regression of population density of 
all species of coral colonies over the years 1982 – 2018 (anova on the slopes) does not differ 
from zero is p > 0.80 (df 1, 191).  B --- Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The probability 
that the slope of the regression of population density of all species of coral colonies over the 
years 1985 – 2024 does not differ from zero is p > 0.79 (df 1,158). Each of the dots represents 
data from a transect, not just a coral colony. 
Prevalence of coral recruits 
One aspect of coral population dynamics that may be a key factor in the success of American 
Samoan corals during the Anthropocene is the prevalence and continuity of coral recruitment. 
About a hundred of the species found in our transects on the forereefs of the American Samoan 
Archipelago have recruits (defined as corals < 5 cm diameter) representing a substantial portion 
of their size distributions (Appendix 2). Combining the diameters of all species on all transects at 
all sites for all years, the recruits made up 23.60% of the combined size distributions (Fig. 3).

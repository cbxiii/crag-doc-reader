APPENDIX 1 – Taxonomic Notes   
Pavona varians are combined with P. chiriquiensis in this report because they were not usually 
distinguished in the early surveys and so we cannot reliably sort them out among data from 
earlier years. Dick Randall always recognized them as different species. He called P. 
chiriquiensis “Pavona collines”.  “Collines” are little hills.  The species was not officially 
described until 2001 when it was described from Panamá by Glynn, Maté. And Stemann (2001). 
We have no worries when combining their analysis because they seem to have the same 
ecological roles and they are both common. 
That Montipora verrilli was abundant, but completely disappeared after 2002, while M. grisea 
suddenly appeared in full abundance in 1995 might suggest that since encrusting Montipora 
species are usually hard to tell apart, this may all be a result of confused identification. However, 
both Dick Randall and Craig Mundy independently distinguished and recoded both M. verrilli 
and M. grisea between 1995 and 2002. Both species are common on Guam, and Dick Randall 
includes them both on his publications on corals of the Marianas. I believe the late Dick Randall 
knew these species well, and if he did not see M. grisea before 1995, then it was not there or it

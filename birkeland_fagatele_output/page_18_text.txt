Fig. 12. Massive Porites have been significantly declining in abundance since 1982 on the outer 
coast of Tutuila and Aunuâ€™u (not including Fagatele Bay and Pago Pago Harbor, p< 0.05              
df 1, 367) and in Fagatele Bay (p < 0.05 df 143).  Each of the dots represents data from a 
transect, not just a coral colony.

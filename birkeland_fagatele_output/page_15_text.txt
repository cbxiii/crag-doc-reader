All encrusting Montipora other than M. verrilli and M. grisea taken together have not shown an 
overall change from 1985 to 2024 in Fagatele Bay (Fig. 10A), but there has been a significant 
increase in abundance from 1982 to 2018 on the outer coast of Tutuila and Aunuâ€™u (Fig. 10 B). 
 
Fig. 9. Montipora verrilli was an abundant species until 2002, after which it was never seen. 
Montipora grisea was not seen until 1995 when it was instantly most abundant species. It has 
remained the most abundant species since 1995. Although the regression appears to have an 
increasing slope through the years, but it was not significant (p = 0.059, df 1,107). Each of the 
dots represents data from a transect, not just a coral colony.

Survey transects 30 X 1 m were laid perpendicular to the permanent location transects at 3 m 
depth intervals (3, 6, 9, 12 m) where feasible (Fig. 1). Diameters of all coral colonies whose 
center occurred within the 30 x 1 m were recorded. Fenner usually recorded diameters and 
identifications of corals within 50 cm to the right of the transect and Birkeland usually recorded 
diameters and species to the left 50 cm for the total of 1 m. For each transect, the diameters and 
species were then sorted into seven size classes based on the maximum diameter of the colony;  
< 5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-40 cm, 40-80 cm, 80-160 cm, and >160cm.

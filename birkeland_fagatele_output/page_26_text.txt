but mortality from wave action and/or overgrowth by CCA increases turnover so although the 
corals are growing more rapidly, their size distribution stays concentrated in the smaller size 
classes.  
 
Fig. 19. The 2016 survey by NOAA CRED found that despite substantially greater rates of 
carbonate accretion (from greater carbonate ion availability as measured by aragonite saturation 
state 4.034 ±0.014) and therefore potential for reef-building, the living coral cover on the 
forereef slope at Rose Atoll (far right bar) was significantly less than living coral cover at 
Fagatele Bay (third bar from right) which had significantly less (anova p< 0.001, df 1,54) 
aragonite saturation state (3.818 ±0.022) or potential for reef-building. (Data on aragonite 
saturation state and anova from Vargas – Ángel et al. 2019). 
Since the aragonite saturation state (CaCO3 accretion or reef-building potential) is significantly 
greater on Rose Atoll than at Tutuila, the recruitment of corals is good and lower size classes are 
doing well and population densities are as good as anywhere in our surveys (Fig. 5). It seems like 
the population is robust, with rapid turnover. The high levels of aragonite saturation state are 
good for coral growth, but perhaps even better for CCA. Although CCA sometimes overgrows 
Acropora in Fagatele, corals are still dominant in Fagatele. What makes Rose Atoll almost 
unique in the dominance of CCA over corals (Fig. 20)? Perhaps Rose Atoll has a special 
combination of carbonic ion availability (as indicated by aragonite saturation state) and strong 
wave action.  
Field observations suggest that the increased carbonate accretion is done more by CCA and with 
a greater reaction to carbonate ion availability than by corals. Therefore, the corals are losing in 
competition (Fig. 20), even though the aragonite saturation state, and perhaps their growth rates, 
are especially high.

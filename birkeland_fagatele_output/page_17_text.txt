Fig. 11. Pocillopora spp. declined significantly in population density from 1982 to 2018. 
However, there was no significant change in abundance of Pocillopora spp. in Fagatele Bay 
from 1985 to 2024. Each of the dots represents data from a transect, not just a coral colony. 
Large colonies of massive Porites have been maintaining themselves over the decades (Coward 
et al. 2020), but the more common colonies in the smaller size classes have been significantly 
declining in abundance, both in Fagatele Bay (Fig. 12A) and on the outer coast of Tutuila and 
Aunu’u (Fig. 12 B, not including Pago Pago Harbor and Fagatele Bay). Mound-shaped Porites 
species recruit better on Tutuila (including Fagatele Bay), Aunu’u, and Ofu-Olosenga, than at 
Ta’u, but tend to survive longer and reach the larger size classes on Ta’u (this paper Fig. 13; 
Coward et al. 2020).

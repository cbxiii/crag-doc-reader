Fig. 8. Pavona varians s.l. significantly increased everywhere (p < 0.001, df 1,551) except in 
Fagatele Bay where it has been consistently very rare (Fig. 8A). Fig. 8 B shows an abrupt drop in 
2024, but of course that is because we only surveyed Fagatele this year. Each of the dots 
represents data from a transect, not just a coral colony. 
Two more striking changes in coral communities on Tutuila over the past 44 years involve 
Montipora species.  Montipora verrilli was one of the more prevalent Montipora through 1998, 
but it crashed to very few in 2002 and has not been recorded on our transects for the last 22 years 
(Fig. 9). In contrast, Montipora grisea was not recorded at all on our transects before 1995. Of 
the 6,416 corals recorded in 1982, 1985, and 1988, none were M. grisea. When it abruptly 
appeared in 1995, it was immediately the most abundant coral with 3379 M. grisea recorded, or 
23% of the total number of colonies of about 160 other species (Fig. 9).  Questions as to the 
taxonomy of these two species of Montipora are explained in Taxonomic Notes, Appendix 1.

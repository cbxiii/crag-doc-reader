Fig. 10. All species of encrusting Montipora other than M. verrilli and M. grisea. In Fagatele Bay 
(Fig. 10A), there was no overall change in population density between 1985 and 1024 (p = 0.232, 
df 1,143), but there has been a significant increase in population density of encrusting Montipora 
on the outer coast of Tutuila and Aunuâ€™u between 1982 and 2018 (p , 0.001, df 1,367). Each of 
the dots represents data from a transect, not just a coral colony. 
Pocillopora species have also been decreasing significantly on the outer coasts of Tutuila since 
1982 (Fig. 11, p < 0.001, df 1, 551), but there has been no overall change in Pocillopora spp. 
population densities in Fagatele Bay since 1985 (Fig. 11 p > 0.492 df 1, 154). No change is 
actually another positive score for Fagatele Bay because it is in contrast to the significant 
declines elsewhere.

While benthic marirc algae other than encrusting forms are not often conspicuous in coral! reef
habitats, they frequently form complex associations with high species diversity but low biomass.
Data from the initial phase of a detailed ecological survey of the algae on the fringing reefs
around Tutuila, American Samoa, demonstrate the widespread occurrence of algal turfs, and
illustrate the interactions between species that help to maintain the algal communities. As-
sociations between algal species are often mutually beneficial, and create significant micro-
habitats. Algal communities also help to control substrate availability, and are themselves
altered by the types of substrate available. In spite of their low biomass, other algae must be
considered along with encrusting forms as significant components in the coral reef ecosystern.
